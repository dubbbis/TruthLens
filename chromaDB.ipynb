      "\n",
      "JERUSALEM (AP) ‚Äî When Hamas threatened to call off the planned release of three Israeli hostages last week, U.S. President Donald Trump stepped into the picture with an unexpected ultimatum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump called on Hamas to release all of the more than 70 hostages it is holding by noon on Saturday. Otherwise, he warned, ‚Äúall hell is going to break loose.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúThey‚Äôll find out what I mean. Saturday at 12,‚Äù Trump declared. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in lockstep with the president, hinted the entire deal could collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamas ended up releasing the three hostages as originally planned. Netanyahu freed scores of Palestinian prisoners in return, and Trump‚Äôs noon deadline came and went with no further hostage releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drama was the latest glimpse of Trump‚Äôs Mideast diplomacy ‚Äî a world of big declarations, chaotic unpredictability and mixed results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, this approach has yielded great dividends ‚Äî most notably the 2020 Abraham Accords between Israel and four Arab countries. But it also has threatened to destabilize an already unstable region and shown little success resolving Israel‚Äôs decades-old conflict with the Palestinians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few takeaways from Trump‚Äôs first month in office:\n",
      "\n",
      "A surprise Gaza proposal\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has built his career on tough talk, threats and ultimatums ‚Äî along with surprises that supporters say are meant to shake up the status quo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump‚Äôs boldest and most controversial plan so far has been his call for all of Gaza‚Äôs 2 million people to be removed from the territory, for the U.S. to then take ‚Äúownership‚Äù and then to oversee a yearslong reconstruction process. The Palestinians, he says, would not be allowed to return ‚Äî a nightmare for a people whose core grievance is the mass displacement they suffered during Israel‚Äôs creation 76 years ago. The Palestinians have rejected the plan out of hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump has not said how this plan would work, where Palestinians would go, who would take them in or who would pay. Human rights groups and international law experts believe the plan would amount to a war crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not clear whether the plan is a serious proposal or an attempt to shock the region‚Äôs players into returning to the negotiating table. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the plan ‚Äúis right on the dot. It‚Äôs the right plan.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Israelis love him\n",
      "\n",
      "If Israel were part of the United States, it would be a bright red state when it comes to presidential politics. Opinion polls last November showed Israelis overwhelmingly believed Trump would be better for their country than Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n",
      "\n",
      "That support has shown no signs of softening. Early this month, Netanyahu was warmly received as the first foreign leader to visit the White House, where Trump unveiled his plan for Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once an idea of Israel‚Äôs most radical ultranationalist fringe, Netanyahu has warmly embraced it since it was floated by Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, the Israelis appear to be taking their cues from Trump. Netanyahu repeatedly consulted with the Americans during last week‚Äôs standoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hosting U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu once again called Trump ‚Äúthe greatest friend that Israel has ever had‚Äù in the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the two nations stood ‚Äúshoulder to shoulder‚Äù in confronting archenemy Iran and that he was working in ‚Äúfull cooperation‚Äù with Trump on a postwar plan for Gaza. He even adopted Trump‚Äôs language in threatening to open ‚Äúthe gates of hell‚Äù on Hamas if remaining hostages aren‚Äôt released. Yet he has continued with ceasefire talks at the prodding of the Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arab angst\n",
      "\n",
      "America‚Äôs closest Arab allies have rejected Trump‚Äôs plans, which pose an existential threat to the Palestinian cause and their own stability. But some also face the threat of Trump cutting off badly needed aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "King Abdullah II of Jordan, one of Trump‚Äôs hoped-for destinations for uprooted Palestinians, gently refused the plan during his own White House visit last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Egypt, which borders Gaza and has been named as another potential landing spot for displaced Palestinians, has also ruled it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key test for Trump is Rubio‚Äôs visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump and Netanyahu have made clear they would like to see the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Saudis oppose the mass transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza and want a clear pathway for Palestinian independence as part of any normalization deal with Israel. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‚Äôs accusations that Israel committed ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù in Gaza could also complicate the talks.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the war\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump‚Äôs postwar plan has sent shockwaves across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endorsing the forced expulsion of millions of Palestinians would be risky for U.S. allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The populations of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are deeply sympathetic to the Palestinian people and going along with such a plan could trigger domestic unrest. Egypt has warned it could endanger its peace agreement with Israel ‚Äî a cornerstone of regional stability for nearly half a century.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Trump‚Äôs plan appears to have bred a sense of urgency. Egypt says it is now working on its own postwar plan for Gaza and is set to host an Arab summit later this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rubio has said that if others don‚Äôt like the American ideas, they should offer an alternative. ‚ÄúIt may have shocked and surprised many, but what cannot continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place,‚Äù he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Arabs‚Äô perspective, what has been tried and failed for decades is America‚Äôs unquestioning support for Israel as it occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state, expands settlements and tries to impose a military solution on the conflict ‚Äî all of which is set to accelerate under Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "More uncertainty ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump‚Äôs Mideast team, led by envoy Steve Witkoff, played a key role in securing the current six-week ceasefire, even before taking office.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current phase of the ceasefire is set to expire in two weeks, and Netanyahu has sent mixed signals about what happens next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly threatened to resume the war, as demanded by the hard-line partners in his governing coalition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he also has committed to continuing negotiations on a second stage that could ultimately end the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "It‚Äôs impossible to say which path he and his unpredictable friend in the White House will choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "By JOSEF FEDERMAN\n",

      "Associated Press\n",
      "üîπ Retrieved: Presidents or dictators? Battle for power raises alarm as Trump turns to the Supreme Court It is well to remind ourselves that today is President‚Äôs Day, not Dictator‚Äôs Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the things the framers of the Constitution worried about, their biggest worry was that a president would become as powerful as a king. Which is why they created Congress and the judiciary ‚Äî to check and constrain him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the first Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century, when inequalities of income and wealth had become extreme that the so-called ‚ÄúRobber Barons‚Äù of the era (think Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg) controlled the economy, and corruption was rampant. (I say ‚Äúfirst‚Äù Gilded Age because we are now clearly in the second.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Reformers of that era created an income tax to try to limit the Robber Barons‚Äô incomes, limits on corporate campaign expenditures to limit their political reach, and independent regulatory agencies to limit their power. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, was established as an independent agency in 1914, to take on corporate monopolies and fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward again to today. There are by now 19 independent regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Office of Special Counsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "These independent agencies, staffed with experts, have become a major countervailing power to the political clout of large corporations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I fear that the Supreme Court is about to end their independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, White House lawyers asked the justices to allow Trump to fire the head of an independent watchdog agency. It‚Äôs the first case to reach the Supreme Court arising from the blizzard of actions taken by Trump in the early weeks of the new administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House‚Äôs emergency application asks the Supreme Court to vacate a federal trial judge‚Äôs order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Office of Special Counsel ‚Äî a little-known but important independent agency ‚Äî enforces federal whistleblower laws, which protect whistleblowers from political retribution, and the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in most political activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1978 law that established the Office of Special Counsel, Congress gave the Counsel a five-year term and provided that he or she could be removed only for ‚Äúinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "But Trump‚Äôs one-sentence email to Dellinger on Feb. 7 gave no reasons for firing him, effective immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dellinger sued. He called his removal illegal and argued that nothing about his performance could possibly meet the standard Congress laid out for dismissing a special counsel:\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúSince my arrival at OSC last year, I could not be more proud of all we have accomplished. The agency‚Äôs work has earned praise from advocates for whistleblowers, veterans, and others. The effort to remove me has no factual nor legal basis ‚Äî none ‚Äî which means it is illegal.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since February 7, Dellinger has continued to police the government against Hatch Act and whistle-blower violations ‚Äî even when they have involved federal workers who allegedly discriminated against Trump. (In a complaint filed last Tuesday, Dellinger alleged that, during a hurricane response in October, an aid supervisor for the Federal Emergency Management Agency illegally instructed FEMA workers not to visit homes with Trump signs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Monday night, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump from firing Dellinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Jackson wrote that the 1978 law ‚Äúexpresses Congress‚Äôs clear intent to ensure the independence of the special counsel and insulate his work from being buffeted by the winds of political change,‚Äù adding that the government‚Äôs ‚Äúonly response to this inarguable reading of the text is that the statute is unconstitutional.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected Trump‚Äôs emergency motion for a stay of Judge Jackson‚Äôs ruling. The unsigned majority opinion said the government‚Äôs motion was premature.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúThe question here is not whether the president is entitled to prompt review of his important constitutional arguments. Of course he is. The issue before us is whether his mere claim of extraordinary harm justifies this court‚Äôs immediate review, which would essentially remove the legal issues from the district court‚Äôs ambit before its proceedings have concluded.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In its Sunday filing before the Supreme Court, the White House said the Supreme Court ‚Äúshould not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating to the president how long he must continue employing an agency head against his will.‚Äù Translated: Congress can not limit the president‚Äôs power to fire heads of independent agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make no mistake. This is a fundamental challenge to the basic idea ‚Äî part of the fabric of our government for well over a century ‚Äî that Congress has the power to create independent agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump‚Äôs emergency application took direct aim at a precedent from 1935 in which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Congress can shield independent agencies from politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "That case, Humphrey‚Äôs Executor v. United States, concerned a federal law that protected commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission, saying they could be removed only for ‚Äúinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office‚Äù ‚Äî the same language that Congress used decades later to protect the Special Counsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Franklin D. Roosevelt nonetheless fired a commissioner, William Humphrey, arguing only that Humphrey‚Äôs actions were not aligned with the administration‚Äôs policy goals. The Supreme Court held that the firing was unlawful and the law establishing the independence of the Federal Trade Commission was constitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward again. The Roberts Supreme Court doesn‚Äôt like independent regulatory agencies. Most of the current justices subscribe to what‚Äôs called the ‚Äúunitary executive‚Äù theory, a bonkers notion that the framers intended for a president to have total control over every aspect of the executive branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, the Roberts Supreme Court laid the groundwork for reversing Humphrey‚Äôs Executor in a case involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The law that created the Bureau ‚Äî again, using language identical to that at issue in Humphrey‚Äôs Executor and in Dellinger‚Äôs case ‚Äî said the president could remove its director only for ‚Äúinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down that provision, ruling that it violated the separation of powers and that the president could remove the bureau‚Äôs director for any reason. Roberts, writing for the majority, said the presidency requires an ‚Äúenergetic executive.‚Äù He continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúIn our constitutional system, the executive power belongs to the president, and that power generally includes the ability to supervise and remove the agents who wield executive power in his stead.‚Äù\n",

      "\n",
      "Adegboyega Oyetola, the former Governor of Osun State and current Minister of Marine and Blue Economy has denied allegations made by Governor Ademola Adeleke that he is plotting to destabilize Osun State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adeleke had alleged that the former governor of the state had instructed the State Commissioner of Police, the State Director of the DSS, and the State Commandant of the Civil Defence Corps to mobilize security operatives from within Osun to enforce a non-existent judgment by forcefully taking over the local governments today (Monday).\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that Oyetola‚Äôs actions are aimed at enforcing a non-existent court judgment, which would allow sacked council chairmen and councillors to return to office. However, Oyetola said his antecedents, pedigree and track records of public service in the last 15 years do not support the claim by Governor Ademola Adeleke.\n",
      "\n",
      "He urged Adeleke to respect the Appeal Court judgment, rather than resorting to ‚Äúcheap blackmail‚Äù.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement by the Media Office of the Minister, a copy of which was made available to journalists in Osogbo, described Oyetola as a man of peace who has tremendous respect for the judiciary, rule of law and constituted authority, as such would never be party to any breakdown of law and order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement reads: ‚ÄúFor the four years he governed Osun, he gave a good account of himself as a man of peace, a respecter of the rule of law and one not given to violence. If he is given to violence, he would certainly have fought back violently in 2022 when was brazenly rigged out.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúAgain, in 2022, when Governor Ademola Adeleke employed extra-judicial means to sack democratically elected council officials, Oyetola as the leader of the party, never preached violence. Instead, he led the party members to court.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúThankfully, his party won at the Appeal last week. As a peace-loving leader, he appealed to security agencies to enforce the judgement of the court. How can such a man be accused of a destabilisation plot? I think anyone accusing Oyetola of violence needs to have his/her head properly examined.\n",
      "\n",
      "‚ÄúThe Minister is further seizing this opportunity to appeal to his successor to respect the Appeal Court judgement, rather than resort to cheap blackmail, which has no place in law.‚Äù\n",
