        "content": "The New York Yankees made a series of blockbuster moves this winter but they could surprisingly be without one of their highest-paid stars to open the season.\n\nAfter losing Juan Soto to the crosstown rival New York Mets, the Yankees answered by signing Max Fried and Paul Goldschmidt and trading for Cody Bellinger and Devin Williams. But now Giancarlo Stanton, whose 13-year, $325 million contract makes him one of the team\u2019s most expensive players, has reported to camp with a significant elbow injury.\n\nManager Aaron Boone told reporters that Stanton was \u201ca little behind\u201d due to an elbow injury and noted that he could not rule out an injury list stint to open the season. Breaking his silence about the injury, Stanton has upped the concern with a two-word message.\n\n\u201cGiancarlo Stanton hasn\u2019t swung a bat in three to four weeks,\u201d according to New York Daily News reporter Gary Philllips. \u201cHe added that the pain is \u2018very high.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhillips added that Stanton left the door open to missing opening day for the Yankees and emphasized that the injury is \u201cdefinitely\u201d more than simple soreness.\n\nEntering his 16th career season, Stanton has been seen as a key player for the Yankees, though they\u2019ve overcome his injuries in the past. In the 2024 campaign, he slashed .233/.298/.475 with 27 homers in just 114 games. But he was critical in the team\u2019s World Series run, racking up four homers in the American League Championship Series and slugging .571 in the World Series.\n\nIf Stanton does miss the beginning of the season, that would open up the designated hitter position for someone else. And the Yankees would need to find another option to hit fourth, which was Stanton\u2019s projected spot in the order.\n\nLuckily, after adding the likes of Bellinger and Goldschmidt, the Yankees do have some veteran slugger options to fill Stanton\u2019s role if he does indeed miss significant time with his injury.\n\nMore MLB: Phillies polarizing $100 million slugger explains bold decision ahead of new contract"

        "content": "An expert has issued an urgent warning as an alarming new sexual fetish has become popular in UK.\n\nVorarephilia, informally known as 'vore', is described as the erotic desire to consume or be consumed by another person or creature - in other words, it is a lust for being swallowed whole.\n\nAs Google searches for the controversial fetish grow, people are confessing their vorarephilic desires in niche online forums and subreddits.\n\nSex and relationship expert Hope Flynn urges anyone who wants to bring vore into their sex life to 'communicate openly, establish consent and engage responsibly'.\n\nResearch commissioned by leading sex and relationship expert Rachel Thompson found searches for vore and vorarephilia surged by 26 per cent in the last five years.\n\nThompson's research - in conjunction with a sex positive platform called Sensuali - analysed 160 million Google searches, revealing the growth and decline of more than 100 key kinky words during the five-year time period.\n\nVore is described in a case report in the National Library of Medicine as 'an infrequently presenting paraphilia, characterised by the erotic desire to consume or be consumed by another person or creature' - generally by being swallowed whole.\n\nLittle is known about the unusual kink as, according to the report, there is limited data on the phenomenon reported which appear to be consistent with 'basic vorarephilic interests'.\n\nVorarephilia, informally known as 'vore', is described as the erotic desire to consume or be consumed by another person or creature - in other words, it is a lust for being swallowed whole\n\nVorarephilic fantasies are 'often composed in text or illustrations and shared with other members of this subculture via the Internet'.\n\nPeople are now taking to Reddit to confess their vorarephilic and even cannibalistic desires online - including one man who admitted to wanting to 'eat' and 'bite' his girlfriend.\n\nHe said he has had these strange fantasies since he was 'really young' and wants to play out his kink with his current girlfriend.\n\n'After meeting her, my interests expanded somewhat; she's the only person I've ever been interested in eating. Fortunately, this was impossible, for obvious reasons: I was still thinking in terms of \"soft vore\", in which no damage is done to either party,' he wrote in a psychology forum.\n\n'This is where things get difficult. We've been together a while now and within the past few weeks, I've begun to shift towards \"hard vore\".\n\n'This includes cannibalism: I've been attracted especially to biting at her neck, hands, and nose. I feel that I've done a good job at communicating this to her, so I haven't crossed any lines because I've controlled myself. I would never hurt her.'\n\n'Soft vore', as the man mentions, refers to when a person is aroused by them or someone else being consumed alive, whole and unharmed whereas 'hard vore' is more violent but not necessarily sensually or sexually motivated.\n\n'Earlier tonight, after dinner, I just got an impulse. My teeth closed down on my thumb. It wasn't even sexual; I wasn't aroused, but I was enjoying it. It felt a bit animalistic, this kind of raw pleasure but it wasn't sexual,' he continued.\n\nSigns you may be into vorarephilia According to Hope Flynn, Head of content at IPlaySafe, there are several signs you could be into vorarephilia. Thoughts or fantasies: You find yourself thinking OR fantasising about scenarios involving being consumed or consuming others, often with a sexual or erotic element. Attraction to vore art or stories: You find pleasure in vore-related artwork, stories, or other forms of media that depict the act of being consumed / consuming another. Joining communities online: You are actively seeking out online communities or forums where vore enthusiasts share content, discuss fantasies, or engage in role-playing. Sexual arousal: The thought or depiction of vore scenarios lead to sexual arousal or heightened excitement for you. Adding vore into role-play: You start incorporating vore themes into role-play with a willing partner. Creation of vore content: You may create your own vore-related content, such as drawings, stories, or other forms of artistic expression to explore and share your fantasies. Advertisement\n\n'Later I bit my left hand, and then my forearm. I feel like I bit so hard that I almost broke skin, and I tore back like a dog. I'm lucky I wasn't hurt badly. It was painful, but it felt so good! Both in my teeth and on my skin.\n\n'I've never felt less in control of myself. I especially don't want to hurt anyone else, but I know I can't just keep doing this to myself.'\n\nUsers offered sympathy and support to the man and some shared how they control their vorarephilic urges including breathing exercises and chewing gum.\n\nRedditors shared where their vorarephilic kinks originated, including being fascinated with fairy tales which include characters being eaten to sharing a sleeping bag.\n\n'When I was 11 or 12, we were having a sleep over with some kids who were family friends. The daughter and I started wrestling, as kids do. Me being ADHD and hyper I got into my sleeping bag, acting like a worm and started trying to pull her in as well,' one user recalled.\n\n'We both ended up in the same sleeping bag and almost burst the zipper on the bag. Her being so close to me in a tight space brought about my love of vore.'\n\nAnother said they've been into vore for 'as long as [they] can remember'.\n\n'I loved Red Riding Hood and Three Little Pigs and preferred versions of the story where they didn't get back out, then I remember wanting to re-watch scenes of cartoons where people got eaten (happens so much more than you would think),' they explained.\n\n'Once hormones started turning fascination into arousal and I started seeking it out for that, I found the name Vore.\n\n'When I was really young I saw a scene from The Brothers Grimm where a horse swallows a girl whole and it traumatised me into getting a vore fetish,' a third admitted.\n\nOthers said their love for vore is linked to sexual fascinations with giants or snakes like anacondas that swallow their prey whole.\n\nHead of content at IPlaySafe, Hope Flynn (pictured), urged anyone who wants to bring vore into their sex life to 'communicate openly, establish consent and engage responsibly'\n\nFlynn, who is head of content at sexual wellness brand IPlaySafe, previously told FEMAIL: 'It's important to know that vore is only fantasy and doesn't involve real harm or eating.\n\n'There's a distinction between those who like to consume (predators) and those who like to be consumed (prey),' she said.\n\nShe explained people with vore fantasies might express themselves through stories, artworks, role-playing or online discussions and forums like Reddit.\n\n'These kinds of online communities make it easier for people to find out about it,' she said.\n\n'With popular culture changing our view of things like vampires and humanising them this influences people's lifestyles, habit and behaviours.\n\n'The idea of taking a bite out of someone has been romanticised by films and shows such as twilight, vampire diaries and Venom.'\n\nHope added: 'Cannibalism, which is often considered one of the most inhuman activities has been shown on-screen more and more in recent years, such as in Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and House of Hammer, they both condones literal cannibalistic love or elements of it.'\n\nDespite the increasing interest in vore, and the growing online communities, according to Hope, it is still 'a very niche interest within the realm of sexual fetishes and fantasies'.\n\n'It is not as widely popular as other fetishes and there seems to be quite a tight-knit online vore community,' she said.\n\nThis is, she said, partly because it is still considered controversial.\n\n'Due to its unconventional nature, vore is most definitely considered controversial, as let's be honest eating another human or being eaten by someone is definitely considered taboo and not your usual everyday activity,' she explained.\n\n'It's also not as widely understood as other fetishes and the general reaction to it offer many differences in opinions.'\n\nHowever, despite the controversy, according to Hope, as with other fetishes, vore is 'personal', as she says, 'some people find it appealing and some people don't'.\n\nHope continues: 'So when talking about these interests, it's important to be respectful and aware of consent and boundaries in these adult activities.\n\n'People who get involved in vore should communicate openly, establish consent and engage responsibly.'"

The department attributed much of the decline to cold weather across the nation. Fires in the Los Angeles region may also have contributed.\n\nThe Labor Department reported that wholesale prices\u2014the producer price index\u2014showed a large increase in January, up 0.4% from December and 3.5% year-over-year. Economists expected growth of 0.2% for the month.\n\nConsumer prices also jumped in January from the month before. The department said that prices were up 2.9% from December, and up 3% from a year ago. Prices were at a 3.5 year low of 2.4% in September.\n\nIn a separate report, the department said that those applying unemployment claims fell by 7,000, to 213,000. Analysts expected 215,000 new claims. Even before tariffs kick in, there is concern about the stubborn last bit of inflation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a stew of uncertainty that if [inflation] lasts and lingers over the next couple months, you could see business confidence come down,\u201d said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.\n\nThe Journal Record Stock Index added 56.75 points, or 2.14%, and closed at 2,705.06. Advancing issues easily bypassed declining issues at a 14-to-6 count.\n\nPaycom Software jumped 9.44 points, or 4.73%. For its fourth quarter, PAYC posted net income of $113.6 million; adjusted for one-time items, PAYC earned $2.32 per share. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of $1.99 per share. Revenue of $493.8 million exceeded analysts\u2019 forecasts of $481.1 million. PAYC ended at 209.22, and was the top dollar gainer.\n\nHelmerich & Payne fell 0.23 points, or 0.86%. Van ECK Associates purchased an additional 329,734 shares revealed in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Van ECK now owns 1,522,144 shares valued at $48,739,000, as indicated in the SEC filing. HP closed at 26.54.\n\nOneok rose 2.04 points, or 2.13%. Wolfe Research analyst Keith Stanley upped his rating on OKE to \u201coutperform\u201d from \u201cpeer perform.\u201d Stanley\u2019s price target on OKE stock was $110. Stanley cited current projects and merger benefits, along with excess free cash flow, estimated at $2 billion per year through 2027. OKE ended at 97.85."

        "content": "A statue of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, sits in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Historians consistently have given Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, their highest rating because of his leadership during the Civil War. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWhat will be former President Joe Biden\u2019s legacy? How will Americans in the future consider his four years in office?\n\nEvery American president lands in the history books. And historians\u2019 assessments of their performance have been generally consistent over time. But some presidents\u2019 rankings have changed as the nation \u2013 and historians themselves \u2013 reassessed the country\u2019s values and priorities.\n\nHistorians have been ranking presidents in surveys since Arthur Schlesinger Sr.\u2019s first such study appeared in Life magazine in 1948. The results of that survey categorized Presidents Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the ranking, Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Warren Harding were labeled \u201cfailure.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous surveys ranking presidents since then, including a 1962 survey by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., which showed Jackson dropping into a \u201cnear great\u201d category.\n\nChanging views shift rankings\n\nWhile the surveys point to Americans\u2019 evolving social attitudes, with implications for our electoral politics and governance, they don\u2019t always ask historians the same questions. Some simply ask them to rank presidents. Others ask them to also judge specific aspects of leadership, such as economic policy or international diplomacy.\n\nDespite the relative stability of the ratings across surveys \u2013 especially at the top, where Lincoln, Washington and Roosevelt consistently hold sway \u2013 there have been some dramatic changes. C-SPAN\u2019s four surveys on presidential leadership, for example, show some shifts in historians\u2019 ranking of presidents over time.\n\nSince 2000, the cable network has polled prominent historians every time there has been a change in administrations. So, C-SPAN conducted surveys in 2009, 2017 and 2021 as well. The 2025 survey, which will assess Biden\u2019s presidency, is in the works.\n\nThe surveys offer not only an overall ranking of presidents but also rankings in each of the following 10 categories: public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision and agenda setting, pursuance of equal justice for all, and performance within the context of the times.\n\nWhile Lincoln has ranked at the top of each survey, the two presidents who served right before him \u2013 Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, both sympathetic to slavery \u2013 and his immediate successor, white supremacist Andrew Johnson, have consistently ranked at the bottom.\n\nDonald Trump debuted in C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey near the bottom, ranked 41st of 45 presidents. The rating for his first term, from 2017 to 2021, could change in the 2025 survey; his current presidency will be assessed after he leaves office.\n\nThe Print Collector/Hulton Archive via Getty Images\n\nWhat is a good leader?\n\nAs a social psychologist and leadership scholar at the University of Richmond\u2019s Jepson School of Leadership Studies, with long-standing interests in presidential leadership, I believe these surveys can be best understood in terms of psychologist Dean Keith Simonton\u2019s model of evaluating presidents.\n\nHe maintains that historians generally view leaders, including presidents, positively to the extent that they fit a deeply ingrained image of someone who is strong, active and good. And that image comes to mind when they think of attributes and events linked to a president that suggest he was a good leader. Examples include how long he served, whether he was a war hero and whether he was assassinated, and in that sense, was a martyr.\n\nOn the other hand, historians also easily recall scandals, such as Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate and Harding\u2019s Teapot Dome. These detract from these presidents\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d image, as evidenced by Nixon\u2019s and Harding\u2019s rankings of 31st and 37th, respectively, in C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey.\n\nRace matters\n\nIn recent years, presidents\u2019 positions on race and racism have been important factors in historians\u2019 evaluations of their records. For example, Wilson\u2019s rather startling efforts to segregate federal offices and the military are becoming more widely known as scholars explore that aspect of his presidency.\n\nHis actions in that regard may overshadow his international idealism, which favored morality over materialism and has been viewed positively. He is no longer considered one of our \u201cgreat\u201d presidents. In Schlesinger Sr.\u2019s 1948 survey, he ranked fourth of 29 presidents. But in 2021, historians ranked him 13th of 45 for C-SPAN.\n\nJackson dropped the most in C-SPAN\u2019s surveys, from 13th in 2000 to 22nd in 2021. His commitment to Indian removal from Southern and Midwestern states, not unique for the time, and the resulting Trail of Tears \u2013 the forced and violent relocation of Native Americans from their homelands \u2013 are important topics in today\u2019s political discussions.\n\nSeveral other presidents who lost ground, including James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Rutherford B. Hayes and Grover Cleveland, were associated with efforts to extend slavery or with failure to protect African Americans following Reconstruction.\n\nThen there is the case of Grant. Ranked at the bottom as a failure in the mid-20th century, he had the largest ranking change of any president in the C-SPAN surveys. He jumped 13 places from 33rd in 2000 to 20th in 2021. He had already moved up from second-to-last place in the 1948 and 1962 Schlesinger surveys to somewhere in the bottom quartile in 2000, to a position in 2021 where more presidents ranked worse than he did.\n\nThe 2021 C-SPAN survey ranks Grant sixth on \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d behind only Lincoln, Lyndon Johnson, Barack Obama, Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter. Given the centrality of equal justice, which may overshadow whatever connection Grant may have had to scandals in his administration, such as Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier and the Whiskey Ring, Grant rises in historians\u2019 overall evaluation.\n\nMoral authority\n\nThis all suggests historians have quite simple ways of evaluating presidents. We have an image of the ideal leader.\n\nPrint Collector/Hulton Archive via Getty Images\n\nJust a few pieces of information relating to that ideal make a big difference in whether we view presidents as fitting or not fitting that image. This is particularly true of our perception of how good they were. Presidents\u2019 moral commitments speak loudly to whether or not we view them as good.\n\nInterestingly, on the quality of \u201cmoral authority\u201d in the C-SPAN surveys from 2000 to 2021, Grant\u2019s ranking rose 14 rungs, from 31st to 17th, even more than it did on \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d where it rose 12 rungs, from 18th to sixth. Wilson and Jackson dropped 13 and 18 places, respectively, on \u201cmoral authority.\u201d\n\nClearly, moral judgments loom large in historians\u2019 assessments of presidential leadership.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to reflect the 2025 transfer of power from President Biden to President Trump.\n\nGeorge R.

That also means extra time to learn the lyrics before the tour\u2026 so no excuses.\u201d\n\nThey gave fans the first taste of their yet-to-be-released third album last summer with the single \u2018No Direction\u2019, marking their first new music since the release of their 2023 album \u2018From Nothing To A Little Bit More\u2019 \u2013 which saw them earn their second Number One LP in the UK album charts \u2013 and their standalone single \u2018Thoughts Of A Child\u2019 which was shared last October.\n\nFrontman Alex Moore said in a press release that recording the LP \u201cfelt like coming full circle\u201d. \u201cWe worked on it with our good friend and old college tutor, John Kettle, which brought us back to our roots. The process felt organic, without the pressure to cater to industry demands, and it allowed us to really explore creatively,\u201d he said.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cIt was like being back in college, free to make music without constraints. Like, [drummer Ryan Durrans] Duz even plays a frying pan in \u2018Stellar Cast\u2019, a random touch you might not expect. Album three is real, raw, and everything we hoped it would be.\u201d\n\nShortly after the album\u2019s release, the band will be heading out on a UK and Ireland tour, set to kick off in Glasgow on March 13. From there, they\u2019ll head to Newcastle, Stoke, Sheffield, London, Belfast, Dublin and more. Then, they\u2019ll wrap things up with a hometown gig at Manchester\u2019s O2 Apollo on April 11.\n\nTickets are on sale now and you can get yours here.\n\nThe Lathums\u2019 2025 UK tour dates are:\n\nMARCH\n\n13 \u2013 Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow\n\n15 \u2013 NX Newcastle, Newcastle\n\n17 \u2013 Victoria Hall, Stoke\n\n18 \u2013 Octagon, Sheffield\n\n20 \u2013 Rock City, Nottingham\n\n21 \u2013 O2 Academy, Birmingham\n\n22 \u2013 O2 Academy Brixton, London\n\n24 \u2013 O2 Guildhall, Southhampton\n\n25 \u2013 SWX, Bristol\n\n27 \u2013 Limelight, Belfast\n\n28 \u2013 The Academy, Dublin\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPRIL\n\n11 \u2013 O2 Apollo, Manchester\n\nThey\u2019re also set to play TRNSMT Festival later this summer, as well as Neighbourhood Weekender.\n\nThe Lathums spoke to NME ahead of the release of their last album \u2018From Nothing To A Little Bit More\u2019 last year. Moore said at the time: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in putting so much into something that you\u2019re not genuinely passionate about? I think it\u2019s quite refreshing that people can see that there\u2019s genuine feelings behind these songs, not like a lot of music that\u2019s out nowadays that\u2019s got no emotion or substance behind it. You can tell those people are singing about what they think people want [to hear]. But I don\u2019t give you what you want: I give you what you need.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s never easy to bid farewell to your childhood idol. When Carlos Alcaraz emotionally thanked Spanish legend Rafael Nadal \u201cfor being an inspiration to all of us,\u201d tears rolled the inner him just to see the 22-time Slam winner drift apart from the sport he gave everything to for nearly two decades. The \u2018King of Clay\u2019 played the final match of his illustrious career representing Spain at the Davis Cup Final 8 in Malaga in November last year. However, since his departure, Alcaraz hasn\u2019t been in contact with him. The reason?\n\nHaving dedicated his life on the court and following a hectic tour-level calendar, naturally, left little to no personal time for Rafa. But, his retirement meant he could now finally reap the rewards of his years-long hard work and, Alcaraz respected that. During a conversation with the Spanish publication, \u2018Sport\u2019, the 21-year-old spoke about his dynamic with the former World No. 1 and acknowledged the well-deserved break relished by Nadal, before commencing his Qatar Open campaign.\n\n\u201cRafa and I have a very good relationship, but I haven\u2019t spoken to him again since he retired from the Davis Cup. I think he deserves to be at peace with his family and enjoying the things that he couldn\u2019t enjoy when he was playing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been and is a great role model for me. I have seen that he has congratulated me on social media, but I have not yet had the chance to speak to him. I am sure that the time will come when I can do so.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe former World No. 1, marred with injury concerns ever since sustaining a hip injury at the 2022 Australian Open, struggled to restore his A-game on the tour. Moreover, his valiant effort to clinch a final gold medal for his nation at the Paris Olympics in 2024 also came crashing after he suffered a premature exit at the quadrennial event.\n\nBefore Nadal drew the curtain on his career in front of his home crowd in Malaga, Alcaraz hoped to bid him farewell in the most fitting way. \u201cNo player deserves more to finish the incredible career he had with a title, and I know how special the Davis Cup is for him. It will be a difficult challenge but winning it for Rafa is a huge motivation.\u201d Life post-retirement has been full of business commitments for Rafa.\n\nJust days ago, reports showed fans that the Spanish icon sold nearly half his stake (44.9%) in his \u2018Rafa Nadal Academy\u2019 to a private investment company GPF for a lucrative $100M profit. Moreover, Nadal hasn\u2019t appeared as a spectator at any tennis events since retirement. As for Alcaraz, the 21-year-old has his sights set on the big task.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nCarlos Alcaraz on climbing the ATP ranking ladder \u2013 \u201cNumber one is always a goal\u201d\n\nDoors to claiming the World No. 1 spot were just opened for players. And, that\u2019s an opportunity Spanish superstar Carlos Alcaraz won\u2019t sleep on. The ATP ranking leader, Jannik Sinner, recently accepted a three-month doping suspension from the tour after coming to an agreement with WADA to seal his long-drawn doping controversy.\n\nThe Italian sensation twice tested positive for a banned substance in March last year, drawing acute backlash from the community. However, his absence means that arch-rival Alcaraz can regain his lost spot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTalking in the same interview, Alcaraz, although refrained from talking about Sinner\u2019s doping saga \u2013 \u201cThe truth is little to say. Whether it is or not, it does not influence us. We remain focused on ours and our goals\u201d \u2013 talked about reclaiming the World No. 1 spot. \u201cThe number one is always a goal. As I say, that it\u2019s not there doesn\u2019t change anything for us. We try to improve in our own and focus on continuing to work to reach number one.\u201d\n\nAlcaraz will next take to the court on Monday, February 17. The top-seeded player is slated to lock horns with Marin Cilic in the Middle Eastern event\u2019s Round of 32."

Officials assure everyone that the wheels are turning, but if this pace gets any slower, they may need an archaeological dig themselves to find the completed project.\n\nPlan of the redevelopment of Europe Square (Photo: Ministry of Culture \u03a5\u03a0\u03a0\u039f)\n\n\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b8\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03bf \u0386\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\n\nA Much-Needed Overhaul\n\nThe cave, steeped in mythology as the birthplace of Zeus (yes, that Zeus), has long drawn in crowds\u2014but for many, reaching it is an uphill battle. The plan\u2014a million-euro blockbuster of a project\u2014is ambitious. The project is financed by the Ministry of Culture with approximately 16,000,000 euros from the Recovery Fund. Highlights include:\n\nInstallation of a hillside lift from Europe Square up to the cave entrance, making it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors.\n\nfrom Europe Square up to the cave entrance, making it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors.

The Ministry of Culture threw \u20ac16 million from recovery fund money into the works. However, the cave is still\u2026 well, very closed.\n\nMythology Meets Red Tape\n\nBack in September 2024, Greece\u2019s Culture Minister, Lina Mendoni, took the mic to remind everyone of the cave\u2019s rich heritage and, naturally, to address the why-is-this-taking-so-long crowd. \u201cThis is a globally significant site tied to legends of Zeus and Europe\u2019s sneaky seduction under a plane tree.\u201d Sounds lovely, doesn\u2019t it? Except for one little snag: the area is practically impossible to reach for anyone not in peak physical condition or those requiring specialized access.\n\nMendoni waxed poetic about the cave\u2019s potential after the upgrades\u2014calling it an \u201cirreplaceable cultural asset\u201d once the lift is installed. Until then, let\u2019s be honest: it\u2019s just eye sore standing behind no-entry tape.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s promised when the changes are completed:\n\nImproved accessibility for all, in line with a \u201cuniversal access\u201d initiative.\n\nConservation work to return the cave to its former Neolithic-era glory.\n\nA safer, modernized space offering a comfortable journey to explore its historical depth (finally).\n\nFor now, though, visitors can look forward to hiking busted trails while squinting at posted signs stating, \u201crenovations in progress.\u201d"

        "content": "Credit: TNT, Fox. Edit by Liam McGuire, Comeback Media.\n\nIt always felt like a cruel joke that Shaquille O\u2019Neal was a part-owner of the Sacramento Kings. The transaction literalized what was true for all of O\u2019Neal\u2019s time in Los Angeles. His Lakers teams owned the Kings, but O\u2019Neal purchasing an actual stake was just a twist of the knife.\n\nIn 2022, O\u2019Neal sold his stake in the Kings after nine years as a limited partner alongside team governor Vivek Ranadive. Ever a savvy businessman, O\u2019Neal cashed in on new NBA rules allowing venture capital firms to buy into teams. The Hall of Famer was also selling high, just like Mark Cuban and several other owners did in the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nAll of that may have helped convince O\u2019Neal to move on from his Shaq-ramento era, but the real reason O\u2019Neal sold was to strike a deal with WynnBett. Per league rules, O\u2019Neal could not partner with a sports gambling operator as an active owner.\n\nIt should be no surprise that team officials are banned from betting deals. The more intriguing element of O\u2019Neal\u2019s career during this period is not the part-time gig he sacrificed for that sportsbook bag but the one he was allowed to keep.\n\nO\u2019Neal bought into the Kings two years after he joined Inside the NBA and worked as a panelist on the show for the duration of his tenure as Sacramento part-owner. At a time when Tom Brady\u2019s investment in the Las Vegas Raiders is held up as a conflict of interest for the retired QB who splits time as a game analyst at Fox, O\u2019Neal got carte blanche from his bosses at TNT for nearly a decade in a similar situation.\n\nThat brings us to Grant Hill. The No. 3 analyst for TNT is a busy man. Hill will call his 11th NCAA tournament this spring alongside Bill Raftery. Away from the mics, Hill is also the managing director of the U.S. men\u2019s national basketball team \u2014 and, since 2015, a part-owner of the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nTo show just how impactful Hill is across basketball, he joined Puck\u2019s The Varsity podcast this weekend, and the conversation hardly touched on his media career. But in addition to calling games for both TNT and CBS, Hill is also reportedly a candidate to join ESPN\u2019s roster next season when TNT loses its NBA rights. Depending on when the NBA media carousel stops spinning, Hill could even end up on ESPN\u2019s top team.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the difference between Hill and Brady? At face value, not much. Sure, Hill isn\u2019t calling the Super Bowl like Brady just did in his first season at Fox. And Hill is not nearly as famous as Brady. Hill said on The Varsity that he does not carry much responsibility in Atlanta, but Brady would likely say the same.\n\nHill does have sway at USA Basketball, where he works alongside the sport\u2019s biggest stars from the junior circuit to the Olympics. We could very easily watch Hill call the Final Four this spring, getting access to the best young players in the world in production meetings. No. 3-ranked Duke has a trio of freshmen expected to be drafted in the top 10 of the NBA Draft, led by Cooper Flagg. Setting aside that Hill is also a fellow Dukie, he would have tremendous access to these players in weekly production meetings. Of course, those relationships will help during the NBA Draft or free agency when Hill is helping Atlanta recruit players or during the selection process for the 2027 FIBA World Cup or 2028 Olympics.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the poll powered by Disqus.\n\nWorking as a broadcaster helps Hill as an owner and Team USA executive the same way it helped Brady being around Detroit\u2019s Ben Johnson in the lead-up to the NFC divisional round. In fact, Hill might even have a greater advantage given that (as far as we know) he is not subject to the same league-enforced restrictions as Brady.\n\nBrady\u2019s defenders throughout the season argued that these conflicts of interest were overblown. The upper hand he might get in one role due to having the other wasn\u2019t enough of an issue for Fox executives to hesitate in hiring him or for the NFL and its owners to vote to deny his ownership stake. The most cynical would argue that these conflicts are prevalent across media, and everyone has an angle. Maybe!\n\nHowever, everyone from Fox leadership to the NFL commissioner appeared to be pretty triggered by the idea that he was compromised. Across media, it spurred a debate. Even Dale Earnhardt Jr. caught some strays. The debate was punctuated by NFL reporter Mike Florio, who insisted his bosses at NBC would never sign up for such an arrangement.\n\nYet, between TNT and ESPN, we know of two basketball broadcasters who appear to be fine with Hill\u2019s conflicts. Fox isn\u2019t firing Brady. Earnhardt is a budding media star.\n\nThe media has agreed that this is a real issue, something that Brady and Fox have to address and that networks should ideally try to avoid. So why has Hill skirted it, like O\u2019Neal before him?\n\nTo my eye, they have done so for the same reason Brady has: Their teams suck.\n\nWhen Brady\u2019s predecessor at Fox, Troy Aikman, recently defended Brady on a podcast, he claimed that when he asked Fox Sports permission to join a group bidding on an NFL team, the company had one reservation. Since this was before the legalization of sports betting, Fox didn\u2019t address the conflict O\u2019Neal sold to avoid. Instead, it was this: If the team Aikman owned ever made the Super Bowl, he would likely not be allowed to call it.\n\nAikman meant this story to defend Fox and Brady, but it also revealed the line in the sand. Perhaps it\u2019s not about Brady or Hill having a conflict of interest, but where it lies. It would matter more if Brady owned the Eagles or Hill owned the Celtics.\n\nThey are allowed to tinker around as part-owners of irrelevant franchises. When O\u2019Neal owned the Kings, how often was Sacramento really coming up on Inside the NBA? It wasn\u2019t a factor. But if Brady or Hill can pull off a miracle and bring the Raiders or Hawks back from the dead, perhaps management will come knocking.\n\nUntil then, they are very influential people who happen to call games for major networks, taking advantage of the platform and access that comes with it."

The era of steam faded, ocean liners rose and fell. Cars replaced horses, and the advent of flight revolutionized the President's travel options, opening up new and improved ways to traverse the world. Coupled with America's rising status as a superpower, a mobile president needed to embrace travel.

        "content": "Oleksandr Usyk, a boxing superstar and multiple world champion, is preparing for his retirement. Surprisingly, UFC champion Alex Pereira seems to be involved in his final plans. In a recent interview with \u2018TNT Sports,\u2019 the Ukrainian boxer confirmed the news originally published by \u2018Sky Sports\u2019 that he plans to fight only two more times before retiring. However, when asked which opponents he would choose to face in his final two fights, Usyk named Alex Pereira as one of his top picks. He said, \u201cFirst is, who wins the next [Dubois or Parker] fight on February 22? Next maybe a \u2018show fight\u2019 with Alex Pereira. Maybe. Why not? Alex wants to.\u201d\n\nThis news had the fight world buzzing, and many fans cannot wait to see if the two legends of the sport trade blows inside the ring. However, if this super fight materializes, it would be that the two major sports can and will witness more such events. So, what other UFC vs. boxing fights can we get to see in 2025? Well, we took the help of AI to find out the answer to who will fight next, and how the dream match will play out. So, without further ado, let\u2019s find out!\n\nSean O\u2019Malley vs. Gervonta Davis (Boxing Only)\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSean O\u2019Malley has often shown an interest in boxing, but facing Gervonta Davis would be a nightmare for the UFC Bantamweight Champion. In MMA, O\u2019Malley strikes with precision and has outstanding range control, creative angles, and knockout power. However, boxing is a different discipline, and against an elite technician like Davis, those advantages would be gone in a minute. As per AI, Gervonta Davis will win this bout, purely based on significant differences in footwork, defensive movement, and overall boxing IQ.\n\nvia Imago Credits: Imago\n\nWhile O\u2019Malley\u2019s reach and awkward technique may help him stay competitive in the early rounds, Davis\u2019 ability to analyze opponents, cut off the ring, and react with devastating accuracy may finally overwhelm him. The sheer difference in experience\u2014Gervonta Davis being a lifetime boxer and \u2018Sugar\u2019 transitioning from MMA\u2014would be too great to overcome. After gradually breaking down the UFC fighter, AI predicts Davis will win by knockout, most likely in the middle to late rounds.\n\nFrancis Ngannou vs. Deontay Wilder (Boxing & MMA\u2014Two-Fight Deal)\n\nFrancis Ngannou vs. Deontay Wilder, a long-rumored dream matchup, would be one of the most interesting cross-sport battles in combat sports history. Seeing how Ngannou has revealed his intention to fight him, combat fans might get the duo trading blows in 2025. But how will it play out? With both fighters having devastating knockout power, the outcome would be dependent on whether they fought in a boxing ring or an MMA cage.\n\nIn boxing, AI predicts Wilder will surely have a decisive advantage. Despite Ngannou\u2019s unexpected performance against Tyson Fury, Wilder\u2019s experience, speed, and technical perfection would make a significant difference. The former UFC heavyweight\u2019s raw power is always a threat, but Deontay Wilder\u2019s ability to hit a knockout shot from any angle will most certainly secure him a victory.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by MMA ADDICT (@mmaaddictonly)\n\nSo, AI predicts Wilder wins via knockout, probably in the early rounds, before Ngannou can make any adjustments. However, if the fight was held under MMA regulations, the tables would change dramatically. \u2018The Predator,\u2019 with his improved grappling skills and ability to impose his physicality, would crush Wilder in a cage. As per AI, Ngannou is going to use clinch work, wrestling, or simply his superior skill to fight in close quarters to finish Wilder early. Whether through takedowns or dirty boxing, Ngannou would dominate within a round, illustrating the vast contrast between an MMA fighter and a pure boxer when the rules are modified.\n\nJon Jones vs. Tyson Fury (Boxing & Hybrid Rules Possibility)\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nJon Jones and Tyson Fury have been talking about fighting for years, but the rules of the match would decide everything. If it were a boxing match, AI would greatly prefer Fury. His stature, defensive abilities, and range control would make for an easy night. The reigning UFC heavyweight champion may have awkward striking that causes uncertainty early on, but Tyson Fury\u2019s expertise in facing world-class heavyweights will allow him to adjust quickly. As a result, AI believes that Fury will win by unanimous decision or late stoppage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, the idea of a hybrid rules fight has the potential to completely transform the scenario. Given Saudi Arabia\u2019s rising interest in combat sports, a fight with modified rules\u2014such as boxing with MMA gloves or permitting clinch work\u2014could happen.\n\nIf clinching, elbows, and even some grappling were permitted, Jones\u2019 versatility could provide him with a real opportunity. So, AI predicts that in a hybrid bout in which Fury\u2019s ability to tie up and delay is limited, \u2018Bones\u2019 could tire him down and pull off an upset. However, in traditional boxing, Tyson Fury remains the obvious favorite. But what do you think? Do you agree with the predictions? Which other fight apart from Alex Pereira and Oleksandr Usyk do you see happening? Let us know in the comments."

Joining the Tigers partly due to a friendship with WR Luther Burden III, Wease was overshadowed by him at Missouri despite posting similar production in 2024.\n\nWease\u2019s best moments come in run after. He has the size and bulk to break tackles and enough speed to do damage. His YAC is impressive and the bulk of his biggest moments.\n\nThere are moments of Wease being a nuanced and bursty route runner, especially underneath in the three-step game. He needs to show it more often vertically but in select plays, he can display that, too. Watch the head nod here at the bottom of the screen to get the cornerback to open to the sideline as Wease breaks his route to the post.\n\nHe\u2019s a good-effort blocker with size, strength, and length. It makes him effective in the run game.\n\nDespite his size, Wease isn\u2019t as strong a deep-ball/contested-catch player as you\u2019d expect. He had moments, including a big score against Oklahoma while at Missouri, but he struggles to track and finish. His quarterback play in 2024 was poor, no question, but he still missed out on opportunities.\n\nAthletically, he\u2019s average to perhaps slightly above but it\u2019s nothing remarkable in his toolbelt. He\u2019s far removed from those foot injuries but two in 2021 will need to be checked out and hopefully aren\u2019t a long-term problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Theo Wease is the other Missouri receiver in this year\u2019s draft. He doesn\u2019t play as big and physical as his frame suggests without the ball in his hand but is effective post-catch. He profiles as a Z-type receiver who can work in the three/five-step game on screens, slants, and plays between the hashes. There\u2019s not a lot here but there\u2019s a little to put him on the draft fringe. My NFL comp is former New Orleans Saints WR Tre\u2019Quan Smith, who broke 15 tackles on just 131 receptions throughout his career.\n\nProjection: Late Day 3-Undrafted\n\nDepot Draft Grade: 6.2MED \u2013 Sixth/Seventh Round (End Of Roster/Practice Squad)\n\nGames Watched: at Texas A&M (2024), vs Boston College (2024), at South Carolina (2024), TD cut-up"

        "content": "Singing is an art form. And people spend hours and days and weeks and lifetimes trying to master it. To get that right note, to get that right range, that perfect vocal dexterity, and delivery. But sometimes a voice has that special quality that no one can teach. It\u2019s not about practice makes perfect. It\u2019s about gifts a person is born with and decides to share.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nHere below, we wanted to examine three such offerings. A trio of songs that display marvelous, unmistakable singing voices in country music, a genre where voice and authenticity are key. And this time, we\u2019re going to do it by examining the women\u2019s side of the bracket. Indeed, these are three female country singers with unmistakable singing voices.\n\n[RELATED: American Songwriter November Cover Story: Dolly Parton\u2014The Eternal Artist]\n\nDolly Parton\n\nDolly Parton\u2019s voice is like a butterfly. It\u2019s slight and fluttery but mighty enough to touch every corner of the room. And when she sings songs like \u201cJolene,\u201d that monarch is carrying poison on its wings, right to the ears of the woman who tried to take her husband. Indeed, Parton is one of those instantly recognizable singers whose voice feels comforting\u2014unless you\u2019re that red-headed Jolene. When used to sing songs like \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d you can feel as if you\u2019re flying, too.\n\nPatsy Cline\n\nThere are singers and then there\u2019s Patsy Cline. When people talk about certain others being used as instruments of God, Patsy Cline is right up there at the top of the list of those who just might be. Her iconic voice leaps from her lips and fills a room like the scent of baked bread. It\u2019s sumptuous and unmistakable and cannot be replicated. Indeed, you\u2019d be crazy for trying.\n\nLoretta Lynn\n\nIf you looked up perfect country singing voice in the dictionary, there wouldn\u2019t have to be any words, not a single definition. All you would need is a picture of Loretta Lynn. With her rich, clear-as-a-bell voice, all you need is a snare drum and a slide guitar to keep the party going all night. While her voice is lively and entertaining, it is also as if your neighbor is singing to you. As if you\u2019ve known Loretta your entire life. She just knows what notes to hit.\n\nPhoto by John Seakwood/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images"

In 10 days, the total collection of the romantic drama stands at 30.8 crore.\n\nBudget & Recovery\n\nThe film, in its initial run in 2016, earned 9 crore at the box office. Along with the re-release collection, the total box office of the film stands at 39.8 crore. Mounted on a budget of 18 crore, the tragic love story has churned out a profit of 121.11%.\n\nSanam Teri Kasam Re-Release Box Office\n\nOn the tenth day, despite new releases, the film earned 1.2 crore, which was a very minimal drop from the previous day, which earned 1.25 crore. Sanam Teri Kasam re-release closed its second weekend at 3.95 crore.\n\nSurpasses The Profit Of Tere Naam!\n\nInterestingly, the film is closely connected to Salman Khan and Tere Naam. The superstar was one of the actors who predicted that the film will be a superhit. In fact, he even promoted the film in 2016 and shared that one of the songs of the film was supposed to be featured in Tere Naam but could not! The song was Haal-E-Dil Mera, Poocho Naa Sanam.\n\nInterestingly, Harshvardhan Rane and Mawra Hocane\u2019s film has now surpassed the profits of Tere Naam at the box office. In fact, it stands 365% higher than Salman Khan\u2019s tragic love story.\n\nTere Naam Budget & Profit\n\nTere Naam was mounted on a budget of 12 crore and it earned 15.12 crore in is lifetime, churning out a profit of only 26.17%.

Padres ace Dylan Cease has been one of the game's best pitchers over the last three years. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nAfter acquiring a pair of All-Star starting pitchers earlier in the offseason, the Red Sox are possibly interested in adding another.\n\nThe Red Sox have \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with the Padres about a possible trade for ace Dylan Cease, MassLive\u2019s Sean McAdam reported. The Red Sox\u2019 negotiations were characterized as \u201cdue diligence\u201d at the moment, McAdam added in his report.\n\nCease has been one of the game\u2019s top pitchers over the last few seasons, posting a 3.40 ERA since 2022. He\u2019s also recorded two top-five Cy Young finishes in that stretch, finishing second in AL Cy Young voting when he was the White Sox in 2022 before a fourth-place finish in NL Cy Young voting in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe 29-year-old Cease is entering the final year of his contract. The Padres have also been cutting payroll since the passing of long-time owner Peter Seidler in November 2023 as there\u2019s been a battle for the controlling stake of the team.\n\nAs Cease could become expendable, though, trading for him likely wouldn\u2019t come cheap. The Padres gave up three of their top 10 prospects (No. 5 RHP Drew Thorpe, No. 7 OF Samuel Zavala, No. 8 RHP Jairo Irairte, per MLB Pipeline) to acquire Cease from the White Sox last year. Thorpe was also ranked 85th in MLB Pipeline\u2019s top 100 prospects at the time of the trade.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUsing MLB Pipeline\u2019s most recent prospect rankings, a comparable package for the Red Sox would include SS Yoeilin Cespedes, RHP Luis Perales, and RHP David Sandlin. McAdam noted that Wilyer Abreu could be the centerpiece of a possible deal for Cease. Abreu had a strong rookie season in 2024, hitting .253 with 15 homers and a .781 OPS. The 25-year-old outfielder also has five years left of team control.\n\nAdditionally, Cease is represented by Scott Boras, who typically has his best players hit the open market. Cease also isn\u2019t expected to sign an extension, per MLB.com\u2019s AJ Cassavell.\n\nThe Red Sox aren\u2019t in desperate need of pitching help. They traded for All-Star Garrett Crochet following his breakout season and signed former Dodgers star Walker Buehler in December. They also added Angels starting pitcher Patrick Sandoval, who won\u2019t be ready to start the year as he rehabs from Tommy John surgery.\n\nThose moves have caused the Red Sox to float the possibility of starting the year with a six-man rotation. After the team landed Alex Bregman, Alex Cora hinted that some more moves might be on the way.\n\n\u201cWe talked about winning the last few years, a thing that we haven\u2019t done,\u201d Cora told reporters on Saturday. \u201cI think the front office talked \u2014 we talked as an organization at the end of the season last year, and (concluded) we need to be more aggressive in the offseason and execute.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve done a good job. We haven\u2019t stopped, though. We aren\u2019t done yet, we\u2019re still trying to improve the roster which is the most important thing. I think the guys in the clubhouse, they understand that.\u201d"

        "content": "President Donald Trump's billionaire top lieutenant, Elon Musk, is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a massive protest campaign this week\n\nThe anti-Musk protest movement is expected to ramp up with Congress on recess\n\nNEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.\n\nHundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.\n\nThe backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d\n\nIndivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.\n\nThe memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: \u201cThis is about Musk\u2019s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.\u201d\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he\u2019s calling \u201ca national tour to fight oligarchy\u201d with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.\n\nLike the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk\u2019s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk\u2019s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put \u201cthe integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,\u201d Muldavin said.\n\nAware of the intense displeasure from their party\u2019s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.\n\nThe House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace \u201cnine days of visibility\u201d and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts\u201d of Trump and Musk\u2019s actions.\n\nThe wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president\u2019s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.\n\nFirings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn some cases, Musk\u2019s team is trying \u2014 with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval \u2014 to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTrump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found \u201cshocking\u201d evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk\u2019s influence.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.\n\nDemocrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups \u2014 Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party \u2014 are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.\n\nStill, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.\n\nMoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on \u201cpersuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a true resurgence in energy opposing what Trump, Musk and Republicans are doing to our country,\u201d MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said, adding that \u201cpeople are mad as hell.\u201d\n\nThe Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.\n\n\u201cA lot of Republicans,\" Mangla said, \u201chave not have had their feet held to the fire.\u201d"

        "content": "Fintech start-ups are unlocking another growth lever as Rupay credit cards which can be linked to the unified payments interface (UPI), are slowly catching up.\n\nFintechs like Rio, Kiwi, and Kredit.Pe and others are betting on RuPay credit cards linked to UPI, making credit transactions seamless across merchants.\n\nWhile banks issue RuPay credit cards, these fintechs serve as facilitators, handling distribution, marketing, rewards, and loyalty programs. Additionally, they collaborate with major merchants to offer cashback incentives, driving consumer adoption and increasing transaction volumes.\n\n\u201cWe had a strong hypothesis: once customers start using a credit card for UPI transactions, they naturally begin shifting their savings account UPI transactional. This transition is driven by convenience and an elevated experience. Over time, muscle memory shifts away from platforms like Google Pay and PhonePe as users get accustomed to the enhanced benefits of credit card payments on UPI,\u201d said Mohit Bedi Co-Founder and CBO Kiwi.\n\nKiwi, which has raised close to $20 million in funding, has a virtual RuPay credit card platform, enabling users to make UPI-based merchant payments without the need for a physical card. The platform has facilitated transactions worth around Rs 300 crore monthly.\n\nThe product offers customers a credit-free period of 40-50 days and reward points, along with the ease of use of and acceptance of UPI among a large segment of merchants.\n\nExpanding credit access\n\nFintechs have identified key user segments that benefit significantly from this shift. First, existing credit card holders now find themselves able to use their cards at small merchants, many of whom previously couldn\u2019t accept credit payments due to the lack of POS machines.\n\n\u201cThe RuPay credit card is the only card that will work on merchants who don\u2019t have a POS machine,\u201d said Prakash Sikaria, Founder and CEO of super.money. This opens the door for consumers to use credit at small businesses, a market traditionally underserved by credit card infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, by creating access to credit for those who may not have qualified for traditional unsecured cards. Through secured RuPay cards, fintechs are giving many first-time credit users the chance to build their credit history.\n\nA secured credit card is issued against a fixed deposit (FD), where the bank sets the card\u2019s credit limit based on the FD amount. This ensures that even if a customer defaults, the bank can recover its funds without any risk to the principal.\n\nTo expand credit access while minimising risk, super.money has adopted the secured credit model. \u201cThere is a huge base of customers who are not being given an unsecured card. A secured card is a product catered to that demand, allowing more people to access credit,\u201d added Sikaria.\n\nInnovations for revenue\n\nAs fintechs continue to expand the reach of RuPay credit cards on UPI, they are also innovating new ways to generate revenue.\n\nMost of these companies operate as credit enablers rather than direct issuers, partnering with banks to distribute and manage RuPay credit cards. This allows them to earn through card activation incentives and a share of user spending.\n\n\u201cEvery time a bank issues a credit card through Kiwi, we earn a distribution payout, similar to any third-party agent,\u201d said Bedi.\n\nAdditionally, fintechs are monetising user engagement and transaction volumes. Unlike traditional credit card holders, who typically make around 8\u20139 transactions per month, users of UPI-linked RuPay credit cards are spending much more frequently. \u201cIn a standard credit card setup, the average user makes fewer than 10 transactions a month. However, cash credit on UPI transactions, for cards that are managed by Kiwi, do about 22 to 24 transactions a month. Basically, customers pull out kiwi almost everyday,\u201d he added. This higher transaction frequency enhances user retention and increases the potential for fintechs to earn commission-based revenues from banks.\n\nAnother key revenue driver is merchant partnerships, where fintechs collaborate with large retailers to offer exclusive rewards, discounts, and cashback incentives. These partnerships encourage users to transact via RuPay credit cards on UPI, increasing overall spending while driving value for both merchants and fintech platforms. \u201cUPI is typically seen as a convenience-driven payment mode, whereas credit cards are about rewards and benefits,\u201d said Sikaria. \u201cBy combining the two, we\u2019re creating an ecosystem where UPI transactions become more rewarding, encouraging users to spend more.\u201d\n\nBeyond transactions, fintechs are also exploring value-added financial products, such as credit lines on UPI, secured credit cards, and digital wallets, to build a sustainable business model. Many are now looking at UPI Lounge Access, BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) solutions, and subscription-based financial tools to further monetize their platforms.\n\nKiwi has launched UPI-based lounge access at 22 airports, allowing users to enter lounges simply by scanning a QR code.\n\nAs UPI evolves beyond basic payments, fintechs are positioning themselves not just as payment facilitators but as comprehensive financial service providers."

        "content": "The legacy of protest songs is rich, deep, and musically diverse. There are tunes in almost any genre that, over the decades, carry the socio-political messages of the times and, often frustratingly, remain relevant today. From Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan to Bob Marley, the Staple Singers, and even Beyonce, these typically transcend the era in which they were initially popular.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the case with \u201cStrange Fruit.\u201d The haunting ballad, part jazz/part offbeat folk, was penned in the late \u201830s. Its spellbinding, sometimes brutally evocative lyrics describe lynchings in the American South. Perhaps most astonishing is that a white Jewish communist teacher from New York City created it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind that?\n\nThe author of \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d was a Jewish high school instructor with socialist connections named Abel Meeropol. In 1921, he graduated from and taught English at DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx, New York. During his time there, one of his students was James Baldwin, later a key advocate and scholar in the civil rights movement.\n\nIn the mid-\u201930s, Meeropol was stricken by a newspaper picture taken in 1930 of a lynching of two Black men, shown hanging from trees in Marion, Indiana. So moved and horrified by that photograph, which itself is now iconic, Meeropol wrote a poem expressing his feelings about the shocking events caused by racial unrest in the United States. He named it \u201cBitter Fruit.\u201d\n\nHis riveting words, which never directly mention the word \u201clynching,\u201d remain intense and disturbing despite, or more likely because of, their implied imagery.\n\n\u201cSouthern trees bear a strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root / Black body swinging in the Southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees...\u201d\n\nThe poem was published in a 1937 issue of a regional periodical for New York City teachers. But it soon became a song, with its melancholy music, also by Meeropol under the pseudonym of Lewis Allan. Changed to \u201cStrange Fruit,\u201d the melody, first performed by Meeropol\u2019s wife, Anne, was delivered at union rallies and eventually at Madison Square Garden, where it was sung by a Black vocalist named Laura Duncan.\n\nHow did \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d get popular?\n\nExactly how and who initially presented the song to Billie Holiday is the subject of some dispute. Regardless, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d quickly became a controversial feature of her sets. The singer was only 23 when she introduced the song in March 1939 at the New York club Caf\u00e9 Society. She closed her show with it, requiring all waiters and the bar to stop serving, and the room completely dark with just a spotlight on her face.\n\nThere are only three verses and no chorus.\n\nAfter the final words, Here is fruit for the crows to plug / For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck / For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop / Here is a strange and bitter crop,the light was turned off, she left the stage and did not return for an encore.\n\nWhat was the reaction?\n\nPredictably, the song\u2019s divisive nature had various, usually extreme, responses. Some audiences loved it, but others were shocked and even revolted since the mournful lament was like nothing else in the singer\u2019s repertoire. Columbia, her label at the time, refused to record it, although they approved a one-session release from her contract to allow her to do so for another company. Even her producer, the legendary John Hammond, declined to be involved. \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d was finally waxed on April 20, 1939, for the indie Commodore on its Vocalion imprint.\n\nDavid Margolick, author of Strange Fruit: Billie Holiday and the Biography of a Song, wrote, \u201cFor mainstream institutions\u2014record labels, radio stations \u2014the song was too hot to touch. Beyond a group of left-wing progressives, largely white, most people wouldn\u2019t have known the song. The Black press barely mentioned it: It was too radioactive even for them.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d eventually moved a million copies and became Holiday\u2019s biggest-selling record. That was partly due to Nina Simone resurrecting it in 1965 for the civil rights movement.\n\nWho else sang it?\n\nFor a song so closely tied to Billie Holiday\u2019s penetrating vocals and the opposite of a feel-good pop tune, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d has a remarkably extensive, vibrant, and varied history of covers.\n\nIn addition to Simone\u2019s equally transfixing approach, it has been recorded by Annie Lennox, in a blues version by Beth Hart with Joe Bonamassa, and by reggae band UB40. Soul singer Andra Day revived it for her turn as Holiday in the 2021 movie The United States vs. Billie Holiday. And there was the Oscar-nominated Diana Ross, who famously played Holiday in Lady Sings the Blues.\n\nRegardless of the source, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d\u2019s staying power has weathered decades. It remains an entrancing, unsettling listen and a compelling lesson about America\u2019s history, compacted into just 90 extraordinary words.\n\nPhoto by Gilles Petard_Redferns_GettyImages"

        "content": "Kolkata: Four West Bengal BJP MLAs including leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari were suspended by Assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee on Monday from the House for a month for their disorderly conduct.\n\nLater, Mr Adhikari announced a boycott of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's address to the House and a sit-in demonstration by his party MLAs at the Assembly gate on Tuesday in protest of the action.\n\nThis is the fourth time in the last three and half years the Nandigram BJP MLA faced marching orders from the House. The three other suspended MLAs are Agnimitra Paul of Asansol South, Bishwanath Karak of Goghat and Bankim Chandra Ghosh of Chakda.\n\nOn Monday, Ms Paul moved an adjournment motion to be read in the House on the celebration of Saraswati Puja at Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College in south Kolkata under police deployment this year.\n\nThe Speaker did not allow it. The BJP MLAs burst into protest, rushed to the well of the House and tore apart the papers. Shouting slogans, they also staged a walkout from the House when the Speaker warned them of action.\n\nTrinamul Congress chief whip Nirmal Ghosh urged the Speaker to suspend the BJP MLAs. Mr Banerjee said, \u201cThe behaviour of the leader of the opposition and other MLAs of his party is condemnable. Mr Ghosh has proposed to suspend them for a month or till the end of the session.\u201d\n\nHe also ordered voting on the TMC proposal which was passed with support from the treasury bench. The Speaker then announced the one-month suspension of the four BJP MLAs.\n\nMr Adhikari questioned the action on three other MLAs when only he protested in the well. He said, \u201cWe will boycott the CM by shouting \u2018Shame, Shame\u2019 during her Assembly visit. We will also demonstrate at the Address gate on Tuesday.\u201d"
