        "content": "A statue of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, sits in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Historians consistently have given Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, their highest rating because of his leadership during the Civil War. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWhat will be former President Joe Biden\u2019s legacy? How will Americans in the future consider his four years in office?\n\nEvery American president lands in the history books. And historians\u2019 assessments of their performance have been generally consistent over time. But some presidents\u2019 rankings have changed as the nation \u2013 and historians themselves \u2013 reassessed the country\u2019s values and priorities.\n\nHistorians have been ranking presidents in surveys since Arthur Schlesinger Sr.\u2019s first such study appeared in Life magazine in 1948. The results of that survey categorized Presidents Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the ranking, Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Warren Harding were labeled \u201cfailure.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous surveys ranking presidents since then, including a 1962 survey by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., which showed Jackson dropping into a \u201cnear great\u201d category.\n\nChanging views shift rankings\n\nWhile the surveys point to Americans\u2019 evolving social attitudes, with implications for our electoral politics and governance, they don\u2019t always ask historians the same questions. Some simply ask them to rank presidents. Others ask them to also judge specific aspects of leadership, such as economic policy or international diplomacy.\n\nDespite the relative stability of the ratings across surveys \u2013 especially at the top, where Lincoln, Washington and Roosevelt consistently hold sway \u2013 there have been some dramatic changes. C-SPAN\u2019s four surveys on presidential leadership, for example, show some shifts in historians\u2019 ranking of presidents over time.\n\nSince 2000, the cable network has polled prominent historians every time there has been a change in administrations. So, C-SPAN conducted surveys in 2009, 2017 and 2021 as well. The 2025 survey, which will assess Biden\u2019s presidency, is in the works.\n\nThe surveys offer not only an overall ranking of presidents but also rankings in each of the following 10 categories: public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision and agenda setting, pursuance of equal justice for all, and performance within the context of the times.\n\nWhile Lincoln has ranked at the top of each survey, the two presidents who served right before him \u2013 Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, both sympathetic to slavery \u2013 and his immediate successor, white supremacist Andrew Johnson, have consistently ranked at the bottom.\n\nDonald Trump debuted in C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey near the bottom, ranked 41st of 45 presidents. The rating for his first term, from 2017 to 2021, could change in the 2025 survey; his current presidency will be assessed after he leaves office.\n\nThe Print Collector/Hulton Archive via Getty Images\n\nWhat is a good leader?\n\nAs a social psychologist and leadership scholar at the University of Richmond\u2019s Jepson School of Leadership Studies, with long-standing interests in presidential leadership, I believe these surveys can be best understood in terms of psychologist Dean Keith Simonton\u2019s model of evaluating presidents.\n\nHe maintains that historians generally view leaders, including presidents, positively to the extent that they fit a deeply ingrained image of someone who is strong, active and good. And that image comes to mind when they think of attributes and events linked to a president that suggest he was a good leader. Examples include how long he served, whether he was a war hero and whether he was assassinated, and in that sense, was a martyr.\n\nOn the other hand, historians also easily recall scandals, such as Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate and Harding\u2019s Teapot Dome. These detract from these presidents\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d image, as evidenced by Nixon\u2019s and Harding\u2019s rankings of 31st and 37th, respectively, in C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey.\n\nRace matters\n\nIn recent years, presidents\u2019 positions on race and racism have been important factors in historians\u2019 evaluations of their records. For example, Wilson\u2019s rather startling efforts to segregate federal offices and the military are becoming more widely known as scholars explore that aspect of his presidency.\n\nHis actions in that regard may overshadow his international idealism, which favored morality over materialism and has been viewed positively. He is no longer considered one of our \u201cgreat\u201d presidents. In Schlesinger Sr.\u2019s 1948 survey, he ranked fourth of 29 presidents. But in 2021, historians ranked him 13th of 45 for C-SPAN.\n\nJackson dropped the most in C-SPAN\u2019s surveys, from 13th in 2000 to 22nd in 2021. His commitment to Indian removal from Southern and Midwestern states, not unique for the time, and the resulting Trail of Tears \u2013 the forced and violent relocation of Native Americans from their homelands \u2013 are important topics in today\u2019s political discussions.\n\nSeveral other presidents who lost ground, including James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Rutherford B. Hayes and Grover Cleveland, were associated with efforts to extend slavery or with failure to protect African Americans following Reconstruction.\n\nThen there is the case of Grant. Ranked at the bottom as a failure in the mid-20th century, he had the largest ranking change of any president in the C-SPAN surveys. He jumped 13 places from 33rd in 2000 to 20th in 2021. He had already moved up from second-to-last place in the 1948 and 1962 Schlesinger surveys to somewhere in the bottom quartile in 2000, to a position in 2021 where more presidents ranked worse than he did.\n\nThe 2021 C-SPAN survey ranks Grant sixth on \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d behind only Lincoln, Lyndon Johnson, Barack Obama, Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter. Given the centrality of equal justice, which may overshadow whatever connection Grant may have had to scandals in his administration, such as Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier and the Whiskey Ring, Grant rises in historians\u2019 overall evaluation.\n\nMoral authority\n\nThis all suggests historians have quite simple ways of evaluating presidents. We have an image of the ideal leader.\n\nPrint Collector/Hulton Archive via Getty Images\n\nJust a few pieces of information relating to that ideal make a big difference in whether we view presidents as fitting or not fitting that image. This is particularly true of our perception of how good they were. Presidents\u2019 moral commitments speak loudly to whether or not we view them as good.\n\nInterestingly, on the quality of \u201cmoral authority\u201d in the C-SPAN surveys from 2000 to 2021, Grant\u2019s ranking rose 14 rungs, from 31st to 17th, even more than it did on \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d where it rose 12 rungs, from 18th to sixth. Wilson and Jackson dropped 13 and 18 places, respectively, on \u201cmoral authority.\u201d\n\nClearly, moral judgments loom large in historians\u2019 assessments of presidential leadership.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to reflect the 2025 transfer of power from President Biden to President Trump.\n\nGeorge R.

That also means extra time to learn the lyrics before the tour\u2026 so no excuses.\u201d\n\nThey gave fans the first taste of their yet-to-be-released third album last summer with the single \u2018No Direction\u2019, marking their first new music since the release of their 2023 album \u2018From Nothing To A Little Bit More\u2019 \u2013 which saw them earn their second Number One LP in the UK album charts \u2013 and their standalone single \u2018Thoughts Of A Child\u2019 which was shared last October.\n\nFrontman Alex Moore said in a press release that recording the LP \u201cfelt like coming full circle\u201d. \u201cWe worked on it with our good friend and old college tutor, John Kettle, which brought us back to our roots. The process felt organic, without the pressure to cater to industry demands, and it allowed us to really explore creatively,\u201d he said.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cIt was like being back in college, free to make music without constraints. Like, [drummer Ryan Durrans] Duz even plays a frying pan in \u2018Stellar Cast\u2019, a random touch you might not expect. Album three is real, raw, and everything we hoped it would be.\u201d\n\nShortly after the album\u2019s release, the band will be heading out on a UK and Ireland tour, set to kick off in Glasgow on March 13. From there, they\u2019ll head to Newcastle, Stoke, Sheffield, London, Belfast, Dublin and more. Then, they\u2019ll wrap things up with a hometown gig at Manchester\u2019s O2 Apollo on April 11.\n\nTickets are on sale now and you can get yours here.\n\nThe Lathums\u2019 2025 UK tour dates are:\n\nMARCH\n\n13 \u2013 Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow\n\n15 \u2013 NX Newcastle, Newcastle\n\n17 \u2013 Victoria Hall, Stoke\n\n18 \u2013 Octagon, Sheffield\n\n20 \u2013 Rock City, Nottingham\n\n21 \u2013 O2 Academy, Birmingham\n\n22 \u2013 O2 Academy Brixton, London\n\n24 \u2013 O2 Guildhall, Southhampton\n\n25 \u2013 SWX, Bristol\n\n27 \u2013 Limelight, Belfast\n\n28 \u2013 The Academy, Dublin\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPRIL\n\n11 \u2013 O2 Apollo, Manchester\n\nThey\u2019re also set to play TRNSMT Festival later this summer, as well as Neighbourhood Weekender.\n\nThe Lathums spoke to NME ahead of the release of their last album \u2018From Nothing To A Little Bit More\u2019 last year. Moore said at the time: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in putting so much into something that you\u2019re not genuinely passionate about? I think it\u2019s quite refreshing that people can see that there\u2019s genuine feelings behind these songs, not like a lot of music that\u2019s out nowadays that\u2019s got no emotion or substance behind it. You can tell those people are singing about what they think people want [to hear]. But I don\u2019t give you what you want: I give you what you need.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s never easy to bid farewell to your childhood idol. When Carlos Alcaraz emotionally thanked Spanish legend Rafael Nadal \u201cfor being an inspiration to all of us,\u201d tears rolled the inner him just to see the 22-time Slam winner drift apart from the sport he gave everything to for nearly two decades. The \u2018King of Clay\u2019 played the final match of his illustrious career representing Spain at the Davis Cup Final 8 in Malaga in November last year. However, since his departure, Alcaraz hasn\u2019t been in contact with him. The reason?\n\nHaving dedicated his life on the court and following a hectic tour-level calendar, naturally, left little to no personal time for Rafa. But, his retirement meant he could now finally reap the rewards of his years-long hard work and, Alcaraz respected that. During a conversation with the Spanish publication, \u2018Sport\u2019, the 21-year-old spoke about his dynamic with the former World No. 1 and acknowledged the well-deserved break relished by Nadal, before commencing his Qatar Open campaign.\n\n\u201cRafa and I have a very good relationship, but I haven\u2019t spoken to him again since he retired from the Davis Cup. I think he deserves to be at peace with his family and enjoying the things that he couldn\u2019t enjoy when he was playing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been and is a great role model for me. I have seen that he has congratulated me on social media, but I have not yet had the chance to speak to him. I am sure that the time will come when I can do so.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe former World No. 1, marred with injury concerns ever since sustaining a hip injury at the 2022 Australian Open, struggled to restore his A-game on the tour. Moreover, his valiant effort to clinch a final gold medal for his nation at the Paris Olympics in 2024 also came crashing after he suffered a premature exit at the quadrennial event.\n\nBefore Nadal drew the curtain on his career in front of his home crowd in Malaga, Alcaraz hoped to bid him farewell in the most fitting way. \u201cNo player deserves more to finish the incredible career he had with a title, and I know how special the Davis Cup is for him. It will be a difficult challenge but winning it for Rafa is a huge motivation.\u201d Life post-retirement has been full of business commitments for Rafa.\n\nJust days ago, reports showed fans that the Spanish icon sold nearly half his stake (44.9%) in his \u2018Rafa Nadal Academy\u2019 to a private investment company GPF for a lucrative $100M profit. Moreover, Nadal hasn\u2019t appeared as a spectator at any tennis events since retirement. As for Alcaraz, the 21-year-old has his sights set on the big task.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nCarlos Alcaraz on climbing the ATP ranking ladder \u2013 \u201cNumber one is always a goal\u201d\n\nDoors to claiming the World No. 1 spot were just opened for players. And, that\u2019s an opportunity Spanish superstar Carlos Alcaraz won\u2019t sleep on. The ATP ranking leader, Jannik Sinner, recently accepted a three-month doping suspension from the tour after coming to an agreement with WADA to seal his long-drawn doping controversy.\n\nThe Italian sensation twice tested positive for a banned substance in March last year, drawing acute backlash from the community. However, his absence means that arch-rival Alcaraz can regain his lost spot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTalking in the same interview, Alcaraz, although refrained from talking about Sinner\u2019s doping saga \u2013 \u201cThe truth is little to say. Whether it is or not, it does not influence us. We remain focused on ours and our goals\u201d \u2013 talked about reclaiming the World No. 1 spot. \u201cThe number one is always a goal. As I say, that it\u2019s not there doesn\u2019t change anything for us. We try to improve in our own and focus on continuing to work to reach number one.\u201d\n\nAlcaraz will next take to the court on Monday, February 17. The top-seeded player is slated to lock horns with Marin Cilic in the Middle Eastern event\u2019s Round of 32."

Highlights include:\n\nInstallation of a hillside lift from Europe Square up to the cave entrance, making it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors.\n\nfrom Europe Square up to the cave entrance, making it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors.

Except for one little snag: the area is practically impossible to reach for anyone not in peak physical condition or those requiring specialized access.\n\nMendoni waxed poetic about the cave\u2019s potential after the upgrades\u2014calling it an \u201cirreplaceable cultural asset\u201d once the lift is installed. Until then, let\u2019s be honest: it\u2019s just eye sore standing behind no-entry tape.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s promised when the changes are completed:\n\nImproved accessibility for all, in line with a \u201cuniversal access\u201d initiative.\n\nConservation work to return the cave to its former Neolithic-era glory.\n\nA safer, modernized space offering a comfortable journey to explore its historical depth (finally).\n\nFor now, though, visitors can look forward to hiking busted trails while squinting at posted signs stating, \u201crenovations in progress.\u201d"

        "content": "Credit: TNT, Fox. Edit by Liam McGuire, Comeback Media.\n\nIt always felt like a cruel joke that Shaquille O\u2019Neal was a part-owner of the Sacramento Kings. The transaction literalized what was true for all of O\u2019Neal\u2019s time in Los Angeles. His Lakers teams owned the Kings, but O\u2019Neal purchasing an actual stake was just a twist of the knife.\n\nIn 2022, O\u2019Neal sold his stake in the Kings after nine years as a limited partner alongside team governor Vivek Ranadive. Ever a savvy businessman, O\u2019Neal cashed in on new NBA rules allowing venture capital firms to buy into teams. The Hall of Famer was also selling high, just like Mark Cuban and several other owners did in the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nAll of that may have helped convince O\u2019Neal to move on from his Shaq-ramento era, but the real reason O\u2019Neal sold was to strike a deal with WynnBett. Per league rules, O\u2019Neal could not partner with a sports gambling operator as an active owner.\n\nIt should be no surprise that team officials are banned from betting deals. The more intriguing element of O\u2019Neal\u2019s career during this period is not the part-time gig he sacrificed for that sportsbook bag but the one he was allowed to keep.\n\nO\u2019Neal bought into the Kings two years after he joined Inside the NBA and worked as a panelist on the show for the duration of his tenure as Sacramento part-owner. At a time when Tom Brady\u2019s investment in the Las Vegas Raiders is held up as a conflict of interest for the retired QB who splits time as a game analyst at Fox, O\u2019Neal got carte blanche from his bosses at TNT for nearly a decade in a similar situation.\n\nThat brings us to Grant Hill. The No. 3 analyst for TNT is a busy man. Hill will call his 11th NCAA tournament this spring alongside Bill Raftery. Away from the mics, Hill is also the managing director of the U.S. men\u2019s national basketball team \u2014 and, since 2015, a part-owner of the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nTo show just how impactful Hill is across basketball, he joined Puck\u2019s The Varsity podcast this weekend, and the conversation hardly touched on his media career. But in addition to calling games for both TNT and CBS, Hill is also reportedly a candidate to join ESPN\u2019s roster next season when TNT loses its NBA rights. Depending on when the NBA media carousel stops spinning, Hill could even end up on ESPN\u2019s top team.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the difference between Hill and Brady? At face value, not much. Sure, Hill isn\u2019t calling the Super Bowl like Brady just did in his first season at Fox. And Hill is not nearly as famous as Brady. Hill said on The Varsity that he does not carry much responsibility in Atlanta, but Brady would likely say the same.\n\nHill does have sway at USA Basketball, where he works alongside the sport\u2019s biggest stars from the junior circuit to the Olympics. We could very easily watch Hill call the Final Four this spring, getting access to the best young players in the world in production meetings. No. 3-ranked Duke has a trio of freshmen expected to be drafted in the top 10 of the NBA Draft, led by Cooper Flagg. Setting aside that Hill is also a fellow Dukie, he would have tremendous access to these players in weekly production meetings. Of course, those relationships will help during the NBA Draft or free agency when Hill is helping Atlanta recruit players or during the selection process for the 2027 FIBA World Cup or 2028 Olympics.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the poll powered by Disqus.\n\nWorking as a broadcaster helps Hill as an owner and Team USA executive the same way it helped Brady being around Detroit\u2019s Ben Johnson in the lead-up to the NFC divisional round. In fact, Hill might even have a greater advantage given that (as far as we know) he is not subject to the same league-enforced restrictions as Brady.\n\nBrady\u2019s defenders throughout the season argued that these conflicts of interest were overblown. The upper hand he might get in one role due to having the other wasn\u2019t enough of an issue for Fox executives to hesitate in hiring him or for the NFL and its owners to vote to deny his ownership stake. The most cynical would argue that these conflicts are prevalent across media, and everyone has an angle. Maybe!\n\nHowever, everyone from Fox leadership to the NFL commissioner appeared to be pretty triggered by the idea that he was compromised. Across media, it spurred a debate. Even Dale Earnhardt Jr. caught some strays. The debate was punctuated by NFL reporter Mike Florio, who insisted his bosses at NBC would never sign up for such an arrangement.\n\nYet, between TNT and ESPN, we know of two basketball broadcasters who appear to be fine with Hill\u2019s conflicts. Fox isn\u2019t firing Brady. Earnhardt is a budding media star.\n\nThe media has agreed that this is a real issue, something that Brady and Fox have to address and that networks should ideally try to avoid. So why has Hill skirted it, like O\u2019Neal before him?\n\nTo my eye, they have done so for the same reason Brady has: Their teams suck.\n\nWhen Brady\u2019s predecessor at Fox, Troy Aikman, recently defended Brady on a podcast, he claimed that when he asked Fox Sports permission to join a group bidding on an NFL team, the company had one reservation. Since this was before the legalization of sports betting, Fox didn\u2019t address the conflict O\u2019Neal sold to avoid. Instead, it was this: If the team Aikman owned ever made the Super Bowl, he would likely not be allowed to call it.\n\nAikman meant this story to defend Fox and Brady, but it also revealed the line in the sand. Perhaps it\u2019s not about Brady or Hill having a conflict of interest, but where it lies. It would matter more if Brady owned the Eagles or Hill owned the Celtics.\n\nThey are allowed to tinker around as part-owners of irrelevant franchises. When O\u2019Neal owned the Kings, how often was Sacramento really coming up on Inside the NBA? It wasn\u2019t a factor. But if Brady or Hill can pull off a miracle and bring the Raiders or Hawks back from the dead, perhaps management will come knocking.\n\nUntil then, they are very influential people who happen to call games for major networks, taking advantage of the platform and access that comes with it."

The era of steam faded, ocean liners rose and fell. Cars replaced horses, and the advent of flight revolutionized the President's travel options, opening up new and improved ways to traverse the world. Coupled with America's rising status as a superpower, a mobile president needed to embrace travel.

        "content": "Oleksandr Usyk, a boxing superstar and multiple world champion, is preparing for his retirement. Surprisingly, UFC champion Alex Pereira seems to be involved in his final plans. In a recent interview with \u2018TNT Sports,\u2019 the Ukrainian boxer confirmed the news originally published by \u2018Sky Sports\u2019 that he plans to fight only two more times before retiring. However, when asked which opponents he would choose to face in his final two fights, Usyk named Alex Pereira as one of his top picks. He said, \u201cFirst is, who wins the next [Dubois or Parker] fight on February 22? Next maybe a \u2018show fight\u2019 with Alex Pereira. Maybe. Why not? Alex wants to.\u201d\n\nThis news had the fight world buzzing, and many fans cannot wait to see if the two legends of the sport trade blows inside the ring. However, if this super fight materializes, it would be that the two major sports can and will witness more such events. So, what other UFC vs. boxing fights can we get to see in 2025? Well, we took the help of AI to find out the answer to who will fight next, and how the dream match will play out. So, without further ado, let\u2019s find out!\n\nSean O\u2019Malley vs. Gervonta Davis (Boxing Only)\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSean O\u2019Malley has often shown an interest in boxing, but facing Gervonta Davis would be a nightmare for the UFC Bantamweight Champion. In MMA, O\u2019Malley strikes with precision and has outstanding range control, creative angles, and knockout power. However, boxing is a different discipline, and against an elite technician like Davis, those advantages would be gone in a minute. As per AI, Gervonta Davis will win this bout, purely based on significant differences in footwork, defensive movement, and overall boxing IQ.\n\nvia Imago Credits: Imago\n\nWhile O\u2019Malley\u2019s reach and awkward technique may help him stay competitive in the early rounds, Davis\u2019 ability to analyze opponents, cut off the ring, and react with devastating accuracy may finally overwhelm him. The sheer difference in experience\u2014Gervonta Davis being a lifetime boxer and \u2018Sugar\u2019 transitioning from MMA\u2014would be too great to overcome. After gradually breaking down the UFC fighter, AI predicts Davis will win by knockout, most likely in the middle to late rounds.\n\nFrancis Ngannou vs. Deontay Wilder (Boxing & MMA\u2014Two-Fight Deal)\n\nFrancis Ngannou vs. Deontay Wilder, a long-rumored dream matchup, would be one of the most interesting cross-sport battles in combat sports history. Seeing how Ngannou has revealed his intention to fight him, combat fans might get the duo trading blows in 2025. But how will it play out? With both fighters having devastating knockout power, the outcome would be dependent on whether they fought in a boxing ring or an MMA cage.\n\nIn boxing, AI predicts Wilder will surely have a decisive advantage. Despite Ngannou\u2019s unexpected performance against Tyson Fury, Wilder\u2019s experience, speed, and technical perfection would make a significant difference. The former UFC heavyweight\u2019s raw power is always a threat, but Deontay Wilder\u2019s ability to hit a knockout shot from any angle will most certainly secure him a victory.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by MMA ADDICT (@mmaaddictonly)\n\nSo, AI predicts Wilder wins via knockout, probably in the early rounds, before Ngannou can make any adjustments. However, if the fight was held under MMA regulations, the tables would change dramatically. \u2018The Predator,\u2019 with his improved grappling skills and ability to impose his physicality, would crush Wilder in a cage. As per AI, Ngannou is going to use clinch work, wrestling, or simply his superior skill to fight in close quarters to finish Wilder early. Whether through takedowns or dirty boxing, Ngannou would dominate within a round, illustrating the vast contrast between an MMA fighter and a pure boxer when the rules are modified.\n\nJon Jones vs. Tyson Fury (Boxing & Hybrid Rules Possibility)\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nJon Jones and Tyson Fury have been talking about fighting for years, but the rules of the match would decide everything. If it were a boxing match, AI would greatly prefer Fury. His stature, defensive abilities, and range control would make for an easy night. The reigning UFC heavyweight champion may have awkward striking that causes uncertainty early on, but Tyson Fury\u2019s expertise in facing world-class heavyweights will allow him to adjust quickly. As a result, AI believes that Fury will win by unanimous decision or late stoppage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHowever, the idea of a hybrid rules fight has the potential to completely transform the scenario. Given Saudi Arabia\u2019s rising interest in combat sports, a fight with modified rules\u2014such as boxing with MMA gloves or permitting clinch work\u2014could happen.\n\nIf clinching, elbows, and even some grappling were permitted, Jones\u2019 versatility could provide him with a real opportunity. So, AI predicts that in a hybrid bout in which Fury\u2019s ability to tie up and delay is limited, \u2018Bones\u2019 could tire him down and pull off an upset. However, in traditional boxing, Tyson Fury remains the obvious favorite. But what do you think? Do you agree with the predictions? Which other fight apart from Alex Pereira and Oleksandr Usyk do you see happening? Let us know in the comments."

Joining the Tigers partly due to a friendship with WR Luther Burden III, Wease was overshadowed by him at Missouri despite posting similar production in 2024.\n\nWease\u2019s best moments come in run after. He has the size and bulk to break tackles and enough speed to do damage. His YAC is impressive and the bulk of his biggest moments.\n\nThere are moments of Wease being a nuanced and bursty route runner, especially underneath in the three-step game. He needs to show it more often vertically but in select plays, he can display that, too. Watch the head nod here at the bottom of the screen to get the cornerback to open to the sideline as Wease breaks his route to the post.\n\nHe\u2019s a good-effort blocker with size, strength, and length. It makes him effective in the run game.\n\nDespite his size, Wease isn\u2019t as strong a deep-ball/contested-catch player as you\u2019d expect. He had moments, including a big score against Oklahoma while at Missouri, but he struggles to track and finish. His quarterback play in 2024 was poor, no question, but he still missed out on opportunities.\n\nAthletically, he\u2019s average to perhaps slightly above but it\u2019s nothing remarkable in his toolbelt. He\u2019s far removed from those foot injuries but two in 2021 will need to be checked out and hopefully aren\u2019t a long-term problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Theo Wease is the other Missouri receiver in this year\u2019s draft. He doesn\u2019t play as big and physical as his frame suggests without the ball in his hand but is effective post-catch. He profiles as a Z-type receiver who can work in the three/five-step game on screens, slants, and plays between the hashes. There\u2019s not a lot here but there\u2019s a little to put him on the draft fringe. My NFL comp is former New Orleans Saints WR Tre\u2019Quan Smith, who broke 15 tackles on just 131 receptions throughout his career.\n\nProjection: Late Day 3-Undrafted\n\nDepot Draft Grade: 6.2MED \u2013 Sixth/Seventh Round (End Of Roster/Practice Squad)\n\nGames Watched: at Texas A&M (2024), vs Boston College (2024), at South Carolina (2024), TD cut-up"

        "content": "Singing is an art form. And people spend hours and days and weeks and lifetimes trying to master it. To get that right note, to get that right range, that perfect vocal dexterity, and delivery. But sometimes a voice has that special quality that no one can teach. It\u2019s not about practice makes perfect. It\u2019s about gifts a person is born with and decides to share.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nHere below, we wanted to examine three such offerings. A trio of songs that display marvelous, unmistakable singing voices in country music, a genre where voice and authenticity are key. And this time, we\u2019re going to do it by examining the women\u2019s side of the bracket. Indeed, these are three female country singers with unmistakable singing voices.\n\n[RELATED: American Songwriter November Cover Story: Dolly Parton\u2014The Eternal Artist]\n\nDolly Parton\n\nDolly Parton\u2019s voice is like a butterfly. It\u2019s slight and fluttery but mighty enough to touch every corner of the room. And when she sings songs like \u201cJolene,\u201d that monarch is carrying poison on its wings, right to the ears of the woman who tried to take her husband. Indeed, Parton is one of those instantly recognizable singers whose voice feels comforting\u2014unless you\u2019re that red-headed Jolene. When used to sing songs like \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d you can feel as if you\u2019re flying, too.\n\nPatsy Cline\n\nThere are singers and then there\u2019s Patsy Cline. When people talk about certain others being used as instruments of God, Patsy Cline is right up there at the top of the list of those who just might be. Her iconic voice leaps from her lips and fills a room like the scent of baked bread. It\u2019s sumptuous and unmistakable and cannot be replicated. Indeed, you\u2019d be crazy for trying.\n\nLoretta Lynn\n\nIf you looked up perfect country singing voice in the dictionary, there wouldn\u2019t have to be any words, not a single definition. All you would need is a picture of Loretta Lynn. With her rich, clear-as-a-bell voice, all you need is a snare drum and a slide guitar to keep the party going all night. While her voice is lively and entertaining, it is also as if your neighbor is singing to you. As if you\u2019ve known Loretta your entire life. She just knows what notes to hit.\n\nPhoto by John Seakwood/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images"

In 10 days, the total collection of the romantic drama stands at 30.8 crore.\n\nBudget & Recovery\n\nThe film, in its initial run in 2016, earned 9 crore at the box office. Along with the re-release collection, the total box office of the film stands at 39.8 crore. Mounted on a budget of 18 crore, the tragic love story has churned out a profit of 121.11%.\n\nSanam Teri Kasam Re-Release Box Office\n\nOn the tenth day, despite new releases, the film earned 1.2 crore, which was a very minimal drop from the previous day, which earned 1.25 crore. Sanam Teri Kasam re-release closed its second weekend at 3.95 crore.\n\nSurpasses The Profit Of Tere Naam!\n\nInterestingly, the film is closely connected to Salman Khan and Tere Naam. The superstar was one of the actors who predicted that the film will be a superhit. In fact, he even promoted the film in 2016 and shared that one of the songs of the film was supposed to be featured in Tere Naam but could not! The song was Haal-E-Dil Mera, Poocho Naa Sanam.\n\nInterestingly, Harshvardhan Rane and Mawra Hocane\u2019s film has now surpassed the profits of Tere Naam at the box office.

Padres ace Dylan Cease has been one of the game's best pitchers over the last three years. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nAfter acquiring a pair of All-Star starting pitchers earlier in the offseason, the Red Sox are possibly interested in adding another.\n\nThe Red Sox have \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with the Padres about a possible trade for ace Dylan Cease, MassLive\u2019s Sean McAdam reported. The Red Sox\u2019 negotiations were characterized as \u201cdue diligence\u201d at the moment, McAdam added in his report.\n\nCease has been one of the game\u2019s top pitchers over the last few seasons, posting a 3.40 ERA since 2022. He\u2019s also recorded two top-five Cy Young finishes in that stretch, finishing second in AL Cy Young voting when he was the White Sox in 2022 before a fourth-place finish in NL Cy Young voting in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe 29-year-old Cease is entering the final year of his contract. The Padres have also been cutting payroll since the passing of long-time owner Peter Seidler in November 2023 as there\u2019s been a battle for the controlling stake of the team.\n\nAs Cease could become expendable, though, trading for him likely wouldn\u2019t come cheap. The Padres gave up three of their top 10 prospects (No. 5 RHP Drew Thorpe, No. 7 OF Samuel Zavala, No. 8 RHP Jairo Irairte, per MLB Pipeline) to acquire Cease from the White Sox last year. Thorpe was also ranked 85th in MLB Pipeline\u2019s top 100 prospects at the time of the trade.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUsing MLB Pipeline\u2019s most recent prospect rankings, a comparable package for the Red Sox would include SS Yoeilin Cespedes, RHP Luis Perales, and RHP David Sandlin. McAdam noted that Wilyer Abreu could be the centerpiece of a possible deal for Cease. Abreu had a strong rookie season in 2024, hitting .253 with 15 homers and a .781 OPS. The 25-year-old outfielder also has five years left of team control.\n\nAdditionally, Cease is represented by Scott Boras, who typically has his best players hit the open market. Cease also isn\u2019t expected to sign an extension, per MLB.com\u2019s AJ Cassavell.\n\nThe Red Sox aren\u2019t in desperate need of pitching help. They traded for All-Star Garrett Crochet following his breakout season and signed former Dodgers star Walker Buehler in December. They also added Angels starting pitcher Patrick Sandoval, who won\u2019t be ready to start the year as he rehabs from Tommy John surgery.\n\nThose moves have caused the Red Sox to float the possibility of starting the year with a six-man rotation. After the team landed Alex Bregman, Alex Cora hinted that some more moves might be on the way.\n\n\u201cWe talked about winning the last few years, a thing that we haven\u2019t done,\u201d Cora told reporters on Saturday. \u201cI think the front office talked \u2014 we talked as an organization at the end of the season last year, and (concluded) we need to be more aggressive in the offseason and execute.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve done a good job. We haven\u2019t stopped, though. We aren\u2019t done yet, we\u2019re still trying to improve the roster which is the most important thing. I think the guys in the clubhouse, they understand that.\u201d"

        "content": "President Donald Trump's billionaire top lieutenant, Elon Musk, is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a massive protest campaign this week\n\nThe anti-Musk protest movement is expected to ramp up with Congress on recess\n\nNEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is the president, but billionaire Elon Musk is the focus for thousands of Democratic activists launching a protest campaign this week to fight the Trump administration's push to gut federal health, education and human services agencies.\n\nHundreds of protests are scheduled outside congressional offices and Tesla dealerships, with organizers hoping to send a pointed message to members of Congress who are on recess this week.\n\nThe backlash still hasn't approached the intensity of protests during and after Trump's first inauguration eight years ago. But a loose coalition of Democrats and progressives is coalescing around Musk's rise as Trump's top lieutenant and his purge of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a major weak link in the MAGA coalition,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said of Musk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of something that polls worse than the richest man in the world is coming after your Social Security check or your Meals on Wheels or your Head Start.\u201d\n\nIndivisible, which claims more than 1,300 local chapters nationwide, is encouraging members to protest at the offices of their members of Congress, regardless of political party. The group also offered a step-by-step guide for protesting at dealerships for Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.\n\nThe memo encourages protesters to stay on sidewalks and public spaces and to avoid any actions that might directly interfere with business operations, such as blocking entrances or trespassing on private property. It also calls for Tesla protesters to stay on message: \u201cThis is about Musk\u2019s political takeover, not Tesla, SpaceX, or X as companies.\u201d\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is launching what he\u2019s calling \u201ca national tour to fight oligarchy\u201d with stops in working-class districts of Iowa and Nebraska this week.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will hit the road for the first time as party leader as well. The newly elected DNC chair will travel to Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri in the coming days to meet with local Democratic officials and labor leaders, spokesperson Hannah Muldavin said.\n\nLike the protesters, Martin is expected to seize on Musk\u2019s role. During a meeting with labor leaders in Pittsburgh, for example, he plans to highlight Musk\u2019s recent focus on the Department of Labor, which could put \u201cthe integrity of data like the unemployment rate and inflation rate at risk, which is important for a stable U.S. economy and, by extension, working people,\u201d Muldavin said.\n\nAware of the intense displeasure from their party\u2019s base, many House Democrats plan to be proactive.\n\nThe House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a memo ahead of the recess instructing Democrats to embrace \u201cnine days of visibility\u201d and said it was essential for members to host one town hall, in-person or via telephone, and at least one community event that highlights the \"devastating impacts\u201d of Trump and Musk\u2019s actions.\n\nThe wave of protests comes at a critical moment as fractured Democrats struggle to stop the Republican president\u2019s purge of the federal bureaucracy, which features thousands of layoffs inside departments focused on public health, education, veterans affairs and human services, among others.\n\nFirings in recent days at the Department of Veterans Affairs include researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, according to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state. The cuts also include more than 5,000 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services and roughly one-tenth of the workforce at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn some cases, Musk\u2019s team is trying \u2014 with Trump's blessing but without congressional approval \u2014 to shutter entire agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Education and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTrump has defended the cuts as necessary to eliminate waste and fraud. And he has praised Musk\u2019s work with his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying it has found \u201cshocking\u201d evidence of wasteful spending. He signed an executive order expanding Musk\u2019s influence.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has defended the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes.\n\nDemocrats in Congress condemn the moves as dangerous, but without control of either chamber of Congress, there is little they can do to stop the Trump administration aside from turning to the courts. Still, three of the nation's largest progressive groups \u2014 Indivisible, MoveOn and the Working Families Party \u2014 are coordinating this week's protests to send a clear message to elected officials in both major political parties that they must do more.\n\nStill, Democratic members of Congress may face their own voters' fury.\n\nMoveOn, which boasts a membership of nearly 10 million, is hosting dozens of rallies outside town halls and congressional offices for those members who do not host public events. The group will focus on \u201cpersuadable House Republicans whose votes will be crucial to opposing the Trump-Musk agenda,\u201d according to a preview of its recess week plan. But there will also be rallies targeting House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, among other Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a true resurgence in energy opposing what Trump, Musk and Republicans are doing to our country,\u201d MoveOn executive director Rahna Epting said, adding that \u201cpeople are mad as hell.\u201d\n\nThe Working Families Party is focusing protests in the districts of vulnerable Republicans in states such as California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The actions will feature people directly impacted by the Trump administration's cuts, including special education teachers, nurses and Head Start workers, according to Working Families spokesman Ravi Mangla.\n\n\u201cA lot of Republicans,\" Mangla said, \u201chave not have had their feet held to the fire.\u201d"

        "content": "Fintech start-ups are unlocking another growth lever as Rupay credit cards which can be linked to the unified payments interface (UPI), are slowly catching up.\n\nFintechs like Rio, Kiwi, and Kredit.Pe and others are betting on RuPay credit cards linked to UPI, making credit transactions seamless across merchants.\n\nWhile banks issue RuPay credit cards, these fintechs serve as facilitators, handling distribution, marketing, rewards, and loyalty programs. Additionally, they collaborate with major merchants to offer cashback incentives, driving consumer adoption and increasing transaction volumes.\n\n\u201cWe had a strong hypothesis: once customers start using a credit card for UPI transactions, they naturally begin shifting their savings account UPI transactional. This transition is driven by convenience and an elevated experience. Over time, muscle memory shifts away from platforms like Google Pay and PhonePe as users get accustomed to the enhanced benefits of credit card payments on UPI,\u201d said Mohit Bedi Co-Founder and CBO Kiwi.\n\nKiwi, which has raised close to $20 million in funding, has a virtual RuPay credit card platform, enabling users to make UPI-based merchant payments without the need for a physical card. The platform has facilitated transactions worth around Rs 300 crore monthly.\n\nThe product offers customers a credit-free period of 40-50 days and reward points, along with the ease of use of and acceptance of UPI among a large segment of merchants.\n\nExpanding credit access\n\nFintechs have identified key user segments that benefit significantly from this shift. First, existing credit card holders now find themselves able to use their cards at small merchants, many of whom previously couldn\u2019t accept credit payments due to the lack of POS machines.\n\n\u201cThe RuPay credit card is the only card that will work on merchants who don\u2019t have a POS machine,\u201d said Prakash Sikaria, Founder and CEO of super.money. This opens the door for consumers to use credit at small businesses, a market traditionally underserved by credit card infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, by creating access to credit for those who may not have qualified for traditional unsecured cards. Through secured RuPay cards, fintechs are giving many first-time credit users the chance to build their credit history.\n\nA secured credit card is issued against a fixed deposit (FD), where the bank sets the card\u2019s credit limit based on the FD amount. This ensures that even if a customer defaults, the bank can recover its funds without any risk to the principal.\n\nTo expand credit access while minimising risk, super.money has adopted the secured credit model. \u201cThere is a huge base of customers who are not being given an unsecured card. A secured card is a product catered to that demand, allowing more people to access credit,\u201d added Sikaria.\n\nInnovations for revenue\n\nAs fintechs continue to expand the reach of RuPay credit cards on UPI, they are also innovating new ways to generate revenue.\n\nMost of these companies operate as credit enablers rather than direct issuers, partnering with banks to distribute and manage RuPay credit cards. This allows them to earn through card activation incentives and a share of user spending.\n\n\u201cEvery time a bank issues a credit card through Kiwi, we earn a distribution payout, similar to any third-party agent,\u201d said Bedi.\n\nAdditionally, fintechs are monetising user engagement and transaction volumes. Unlike traditional credit card holders, who typically make around 8\u20139 transactions per month, users of UPI-linked RuPay credit cards are spending much more frequently. \u201cIn a standard credit card setup, the average user makes fewer than 10 transactions a month. However, cash credit on UPI transactions, for cards that are managed by Kiwi, do about 22 to 24 transactions a month. Basically, customers pull out kiwi almost everyday,\u201d he added. This higher transaction frequency enhances user retention and increases the potential for fintechs to earn commission-based revenues from banks.\n\nAnother key revenue driver is merchant partnerships, where fintechs collaborate with large retailers to offer exclusive rewards, discounts, and cashback incentives. These partnerships encourage users to transact via RuPay credit cards on UPI, increasing overall spending while driving value for both merchants and fintech platforms. \u201cUPI is typically seen as a convenience-driven payment mode, whereas credit cards are about rewards and benefits,\u201d said Sikaria. \u201cBy combining the two, we\u2019re creating an ecosystem where UPI transactions become more rewarding, encouraging users to spend more.\u201d\n\nBeyond transactions, fintechs are also exploring value-added financial products, such as credit lines on UPI, secured credit cards, and digital wallets, to build a sustainable business model. Many are now looking at UPI Lounge Access, BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) solutions, and subscription-based financial tools to further monetize their platforms.\n\nKiwi has launched UPI-based lounge access at 22 airports, allowing users to enter lounges simply by scanning a QR code.\n\nAs UPI evolves beyond basic payments, fintechs are positioning themselves not just as payment facilitators but as comprehensive financial service providers."

From Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan to Bob Marley, the Staple Singers, and even Beyonce, these typically transcend the era in which they were initially popular.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the case with \u201cStrange Fruit.\u201d The haunting ballad, part jazz/part offbeat folk, was penned in the late \u201830s. Its spellbinding, sometimes brutally evocative lyrics describe lynchings in the American South. Perhaps most astonishing is that a white Jewish communist teacher from New York City created it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind that?\n\nThe author of \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d was a Jewish high school instructor with socialist connections named Abel Meeropol. In 1921, he graduated from and taught English at DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx, New York. During his time there, one of his students was James Baldwin, later a key advocate and scholar in the civil rights movement.\n\nIn the mid-\u201930s, Meeropol was stricken by a newspaper picture taken in 1930 of a lynching of two Black men, shown hanging from trees in Marion, Indiana. So moved and horrified by that photograph, which itself is now iconic, Meeropol wrote a poem expressing his feelings about the shocking events caused by racial unrest in the United States. He named it \u201cBitter Fruit.\u201d\n\nHis riveting words, which never directly mention the word \u201clynching,\u201d remain intense and disturbing despite, or more likely because of, their implied imagery.\n\n\u201cSouthern trees bear a strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root / Black body swinging in the Southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees...\u201d\n\nThe poem was published in a 1937 issue of a regional periodical for New York City teachers. But it soon became a song, with its melancholy music, also by Meeropol under the pseudonym of Lewis Allan. Changed to \u201cStrange Fruit,\u201d the melody, first performed by Meeropol\u2019s wife, Anne, was delivered at union rallies and eventually at Madison Square Garden, where it was sung by a Black vocalist named Laura Duncan.\n\nHow did \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d get popular?\n\nExactly how and who initially presented the song to Billie Holiday is the subject of some dispute. Regardless, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d quickly became a controversial feature of her sets. The singer was only 23 when she introduced the song in March 1939 at the New York club Caf\u00e9 Society. She closed her show with it, requiring all waiters and the bar to stop serving, and the room completely dark with just a spotlight on her face.\n\nThere are only three verses and no chorus.\n\nAfter the final words, Here is fruit for the crows to plug / For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck / For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop / Here is a strange and bitter crop,the light was turned off, she left the stage and did not return for an encore.\n\nWhat was the reaction?\n\nPredictably, the song\u2019s divisive nature had various, usually extreme, responses. Some audiences loved it, but others were shocked and even revolted since the mournful lament was like nothing else in the singer\u2019s repertoire. Columbia, her label at the time, refused to record it, although they approved a one-session release from her contract to allow her to do so for another company. Even her producer, the legendary John Hammond, declined to be involved. \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d was finally waxed on April 20, 1939, for the indie Commodore on its Vocalion imprint.\n\nDavid Margolick, author of Strange Fruit: Billie Holiday and the Biography of a Song, wrote, \u201cFor mainstream institutions\u2014record labels, radio stations \u2014the song was too hot to touch. Beyond a group of left-wing progressives, largely white, most people wouldn\u2019t have known the song. The Black press barely mentioned it: It was too radioactive even for them.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d eventually moved a million copies and became Holiday\u2019s biggest-selling record. That was partly due to Nina Simone resurrecting it in 1965 for the civil rights movement.\n\nWho else sang it?\n\nFor a song so closely tied to Billie Holiday\u2019s penetrating vocals and the opposite of a feel-good pop tune, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d has a remarkably extensive, vibrant, and varied history of covers.\n\nIn addition to Simone\u2019s equally transfixing approach, it has been recorded by Annie Lennox, in a blues version by Beth Hart with Joe Bonamassa, and by reggae band UB40. Soul singer Andra Day revived it for her turn as Holiday in the 2021 movie The United States vs. Billie Holiday. And there was the Oscar-nominated Diana Ross, who famously played Holiday in Lady Sings the Blues.\n\nRegardless of the source, \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d\u2019s staying power has weathered decades. It remains an entrancing, unsettling listen and a compelling lesson about America\u2019s history, compacted into just 90 extraordinary words.\n\nPhoto by Gilles Petard_Redferns_GettyImages"

        "content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Harsh weather moved west on Monday as a polar vortex was expected to grip the Rockies and the northern Plains after winter storms pummeled the eastern U.S. over the weekend, killing at least 10 people, including nine victims in Kentucky who died during flooding from heavy rains.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of \u201clife-threatening cold\u201d into Tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern Montana predicted to dip as low as 45 degrees below zero (-42.7 degrees Celsius) with wind chills down to 60 below (-51 degrees Celsius).\n\nMeteorologists said several states would experience the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIn Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that the death toll rose to nine.\n\n\u201cWe just confirmed another weather-related death out of Pike County, bringing our total loss to 9 people.\u201d\n\nBeshear had said earlier Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued. President Donald Trump approved Kentucky's request for a disaster declaration, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts throughout the state.\n\nIn Alabama, the weather service in Birmingham said it had confirmed an EF-1 tornado touched down in Hale County. Storms there and elsewhere in the state destroyed or damaged a handful of mobile homes, downed trees and toppled power lines.\n\nA state of emergency was declared for parts of Obion County, Tennessee, after a levee failed on Saturday, flooding the small community of Rives, home to around 300 people in the western part of the state. \u201c\n\nIn Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell.\n\nDangerously cold wind chill temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero (minus 45.6) were expected in most of North Dakota, which remained under an \u201cextreme cold warning\u201d along with large swaths of South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the weather service.\n\nParts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain, Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service, said Sunday.\n\nWater submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia over the weekend. Flood warnings extended throughout Tennessee and Arkansas.\n\nThe mother and child were swept away Saturday night in Kentucky\u2019s Bonnieville community, Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said. In southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters in Clay County, county Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle Berry said. There were a total of four deaths in Hart County, Beshear said.\n\nIn West Virginia, 13 southern counties were under a state of emergency for flooding and some areas were cut off to vehicle traffic Sunday. Several volunteer fire departments dealt with flooding in their own buildings while answering rescue and evacuation calls.\n\nIce and snow made road travel treacherous in large swaths of Michigan, which remained under a winter weather advisory until Monday afternoon. Michigan State Police reported 114 crashes Sunday around the Detroit area since snow started falling Saturday.\n\n\u201cFortunately, most were one-car spin outs and there were no serious injuries,\u201d Michigan State Police said on X.\n\nAuthorities in Colorado reported eight people were killed in fatal vehicle crashes since Valentine\u2019s Day and warned drivers to be cautious as the weather made driving more difficult. The causes of the fatal crashes weren\u2019t immediately known.\n\nAlso in Colorado, three state patrol cruisers that had pulled over along roadsides were struck by other vehicles, including one on Sunday where a trooper had stopped as officials prepared to close a road because of ice. In each case the troopers were out of their cruisers at the time and were uninjured.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for numerous areas of the Rocky Mountains stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with the danger rated highest in Utah.\n\nParts of a southwest Detroit neighborhood are submerged after a nearly century-old water main burst early Monday.\n\nThe 54-inch (137-centimeter) transmission main was built in 1930 and has left several feet of water over streets, sidewalks and yards, according to the Great Lakes Water Authority.\n\nCrews and contractors were in the area attempting to isolate the break. It was not clear what caused the main to burst, but temperatures late Sunday into Monday morning were well below zero degrees Fahrenheit (minus 17 degrees C).\n\nNo injuries have been reported. Firefighters used a ladder to help one person from the roof of a car in waist-deep water and a bulldozer was used to navigate a flooded street and help people leave a home, according to the fire department.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan says people impacted by the flooding can shelter in place if they have power and feel safe. Those who want to leave can call 911 and fire crews will help them from their homes and take them to a temporary shelter.\n\n___\n\nCorey Williams in Detroit; Sophia Tareen in Chicago; and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report."

        "content": "The dangers of smoking aren\u2019t new\u2014but emerging research is now pointing to a shocking link between heavy smoking and unexplained strokes in younger adults, especially men aged 45 to 49. A new study, published in the February issue of Neurology Open Access, suggests that smoking may be a hidden culprit behind cryptogenic strokes\u2014strokes with no known cause\u2014that strike seemingly healthy individuals long before their senior years. The study does not mention if cannabis smoking is also a factor.\n\nWhat Is a Cryptogenic Stroke?\n\nA cryptogenic stroke is a type of ischemic stroke, which occurs when a blockage disrupts blood flow to the brain. But here\u2019s the catch: unlike typical strokes, the cause of these blockages remains a mystery. The symptoms\u2014weakness, trouble speaking, and vision problems\u2014can be devastating. While most strokes happen after age 65, researchers are now seeing an increase in younger people with these unexplained strokes.\n\n\u201cWhile smoking has long been linked to ischemic stroke, little is known about how smoking affects people under 50, especially in those with unexplained stroke,\u201d said Phillip Ferdinand, MBChB MRCP, of Keele University in the UK and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. \u201cRecent research has shown an increase in younger people having these unexplained strokes, so it is important to evaluate any potential links. Our study found that smoking may be a key factor.\u201d\n\nTo investigate, researchers analyzed 546 people aged 18 to 49 who had suffered an unexplained stroke, comparing them with 546 people of the same age and sex who had not. Participants answered questions about smoking habits, alcohol use, education level, physical activity, and other health conditions.\n\nThe Numbers Speak for Themselves\n\nAmong those who had an unexplained stroke, 33% were smokers, compared to just 15% in the control group.\n\nEven after adjusting for other stroke risk factors like alcohol use and blood pressure, researchers found that smokers had more than double the risk of unexplained stroke compared to non-smokers.\n\nThe risk was highest for men, who had more than three times the risk.\n\nThe danger spiked for people ages 45 to 49, who had nearly four times the risk.\n\nHeavy smoking\u2014defined as more than 20 packs a year\u2014led to an even greater risk: Heavy smokers faced a fourfold increase in unexplained stroke risk. Male heavy smokers saw nearly seven times the risk. Smokers aged 45 to 49 had nearly five times the risk.\n\n\n\nPublic Health Implications: Smoking Prevention Matters\n\nThe findings reinforce the need for stronger public health initiatives aimed at preventing smoking, especially heavy smoking, in younger adults. \u201cOur findings suggest that continued public health efforts around preventing smoking, especially heavy smoking, may be an important way to help reduce the number of strokes happening to young people,\u201d said Ferdinand.\n\nRelated: smoking shisha pipes may just be as bad as regular smoking\n\nThe study\u2019s findings were primarily based on people of white European backgrounds, so additional research is needed to see if the results apply to other populations. However, the message is clear: quitting smoking, or better yet\u2014never starting\u2014could be a critical step in stroke prevention.\n\nIf you or someone you know smokes, consider this study another urgent reason to quit. Brain health is essential for longevity, and smoking is a risk factor that can be controlled.

        "content": "Robert Way\n\nListen below or on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify\n\nNew Apple product seen, but no livestream keynote. (0:21) Walmart commentary on tariff impact expected. (0:48) Traders eye FOMC minutes. (2:21)\n\nThe following is an abridged transcript:\n\nFocus will be stock-specific this holiday-shortened trading week, with the economic calendar relatively light.\n\nTwo big household names will draw special attention: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nOn Wednesday at noon ET, Apple will host a launch event. The announcement is expected to be conducted through a press release and promotional materials rather than a live-streamed keynote. A fourth-generation iPhone SE is widely expected to be featured , although there is speculation about a new MacBook Air, new iPad Air, or a surprise reveal.\n\nWalmart reports fiscal Q4 earnings before the bell on Thursday and investors will be anxious for any commentary about the impact of tariffs on China.\n\nAccording to SA Analyst Jeffrey Fischer, \u201cWalmart concedes that a significant amount of merchandise is sourced internationally, but how much, and from where?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral online sources offered varied estimates, but all of them suggested that products from China represented well more than 50% of the items on North American Walmart shelves.\u201d\n\nHe estimates a hit on EPS could potentially boost WMT\u2019s P/E above 100x.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting a quarterly EPS of $0.65 on sales of nearly $179 billion. Revisions have been bearish in the last 90 days, though, with 18 downward revisions to EPS numbers compared to 9 upward revisions. On the top line there have been 11 upward revisions and 10 downward revisions.\n\nBut Seeking Alpha analyst Skeptical2 says: \u201cWalmart should be able to accelerate earnings growth with increased share buybacks as cash flow continues to grow, and the company should continue to drive impressive growth regardless of economic cycles in what is likely to remain a favorable operating environment moving forward. Existing earnings estimates are likely low as well, since management has also consistently guided conservatively.\u201d\n\nAlso on the earnings calendar:\n\nUFP Industries (UFPI), Noble (NE) and Transocean (RIG) report on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arista Networks (ANET), Medtronic (MDT), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) issue numbers.\n\nHSBC Holdings (HSBC), Analog Devices (ADI), Carvana (CVNA) and Garmin (GRMN) weigh in on Wednesday.\n\nJoining Walmart on Thursday are Alibaba (BABA), Booking Holdings (BKNG), MercadoLibre (MELI) and Southern (SO).\n\nOn the economic front, the minutes from the last FOMC meeting arrive on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to veteran Fed watcher Mott Capital, who runs Reading the Markets Investing Group, the recent data point to a strong labor market and inflation rates that appear to be accelerating, with the market taking notice as 1-year and 2-year inflation swaps trade at their highest levels since March 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Fed minutes are likely to read moderately hawkish and carry the tone of the January press conference,\u201d Mott Captial said. \u201cThe overall tone should indicate that the Fed wants to see more progress on inflation, but at the same time, send a message that the Fed believes the policy is restrictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, the data do not support that, nor do financial conditions. If that is the message of the minutes, it should lead to the bond market bear steepening resuming, as rates on the long-end of the yield continue to push higher.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley economists say that Chairman Jay Powell's \"testimony in mid-February gave a more timely update on Fed thinking than the minutes will. Even so, we\u2019ll look for assessments of recent disinflation, of potential effects from tariffs and policy uncertainty, and of the restrictiveness of current policy.\"\n\n\"Fed officials\u2019 views on these differ, and the minutes may offer information about the distribution of their thinking,\" they said.\n\nIn the news this long weekend, OPEC+ is weighing yet another delay to its plan to unwind voluntary production cuts and resume monthly supply hikes from April, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIf it decides to push back the move, it'd be the fourth time that the Saudi Arabia-led oil producing alliance has delayed plans to restart production hikes since 2022.\n\nWhile a decision will likely be finalized in the coming weeks, the group is split on how to proceed. A delegate cited in the report said global oil markets continue to be too fragile to restart production.\n\nTencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) shares rose to their highest level since 2021 on Monday after the company said its WeChat messaging app has launched beta testing with Deepseek (DEEPSEEK), joining a growing list of Big Tech majors integrating DeepSeek\u2019s AI software across China.\n\nAnd \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d became the first big box office opening of the year, bringing in $88.5 million, according to studio estimates released Sunday.\n\nSony\u2019s \u201cPaddington in Peru\u201d came in second with $13 million. The film opened in the UK in early November. Horror movie \u201cHeart Eyes\u201d came in third with $10 million during its second weekend. \u201cDog Man\u201d came in fourth, and Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d came in fifth.\n\nFor income investors, Ford (F) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) go ex-dividend on Tuesday. Ford pays out on March 3 and J&J pays out on March 4.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) goes ex-dividend on Thursday, paying out on March 30. And Yum! Brands (YUM) goes ex-dividend on Friday, with a payout date of March 7.\n\nAnd in the Wall Street Research Corner, Citi Research analysts highlighted their Thematic 30 list of recommendations.\n\nThese are 30 stocks within three investing styles, including growth, cyclical, and defensive, and organized by several subsectors. The picks have outperformed the benchmark Russell 1000 (IWB) since Q4 last year.\n\nAmong the sectors are Artificial Intelligence, FinTech, Agricultural Demand, Global Tourism and Polution Solutions.\n\nTheir AI picks are: Amazon (AMZN), DoorDash (DASH), DocuSign (DOCU), Equinix (EQIX), GoDaddy (GDDY), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Uber (UBER).\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
