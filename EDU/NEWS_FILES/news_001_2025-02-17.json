        "content": "A statue of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, sits in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Historians consistently have given Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, their highest rating because of his leadership during the Civil War. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWhat will be former President Joe Biden\u2019s legacy? How will Americans in the future consider his four years in office?\n\nEvery American president lands in the history books. And historians\u2019 assessments of their performance have been generally consistent over time. But some presidents\u2019 rankings have changed as the nation \u2013 and historians themselves \u2013 reassessed the country\u2019s values and priorities.\n\nHistorians have been ranking presidents in surveys since Arthur Schlesinger Sr.\u2019s first such study appeared in Life magazine in 1948. The results of that survey categorized Presidents Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the ranking, Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Warren Harding were labeled \u201cfailure.\u201d\n\nThere have been numerous surveys ranking presidents since then, including a 1962 survey by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., which showed Jackson dropping into a \u201cnear great\u201d category.\n\nChanging views shift rankings\n\nWhile the surveys point to Americans\u2019 evolving social attitudes, with implications for our electoral politics and governance, they don\u2019t always ask historians the same questions. Some simply ask them to rank presidents. Others ask them to also judge specific aspects of leadership, such as economic policy or international diplomacy.\n\nDespite the relative stability of the ratings across surveys \u2013 especially at the top, where Lincoln, Washington and Roosevelt consistently hold sway \u2013 there have been some dramatic changes. C-SPAN\u2019s four surveys on presidential leadership, for example, show some shifts in historians\u2019 ranking of presidents over time.\n\nSince 2000, the cable network has polled prominent historians every time there has been a change in administrations. So, C-SPAN conducted surveys in 2009, 2017 and 2021 as well. The 2025 survey, which will assess Biden\u2019s presidency, is in the works.\n\nThe surveys offer not only an overall ranking of presidents but also rankings in each of the following 10 categories: public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision and agenda setting, pursuance of equal justice for all, and performance within the context of the times.\n\nWhile Lincoln has ranked at the top of each survey, the two presidents who served right before him \u2013 Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, both sympathetic to slavery \u2013 and his immediate successor, white supremacist Andrew Johnson, have consistently ranked at the bottom.\n\nDonald Trump debuted in C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey near the bottom, ranked 41st of 45 presidents. The rating for his first term, from 2017 to 2021, could change in the 2025 survey; his current presidency will be assessed after he leaves office.\n\nThe Print Collector/Hulton Archive via Getty Images\n\nWhat is a good leader?\n\nAs a social psychologist and leadership scholar at the University of Richmond\u2019s Jepson School of Leadership Studies, with long-standing interests in presidential leadership, I believe these surveys can be best understood in terms of psychologist Dean Keith Simonton\u2019s model of evaluating presidents.\n\nHe maintains that historians generally view leaders, including presidents, positively to the extent that they fit a deeply ingrained image of someone who is strong, active and good. And that image comes to mind when they think of attributes and events linked to a president that suggest he was a good leader. Examples include how long he served, whether he was a war hero and whether he was assassinated, and in that sense, was a martyr.\n\nOn the other hand, historians also easily recall scandals, such as Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate and Harding\u2019s Teapot Dome. These detract from these presidents\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d image, as evidenced by Nixon\u2019s and Harding\u2019s rankings of 31st and 37th, respectively, in C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey.\n\nRace matters\n\nIn recent years, presidents\u2019 positions on race and racism have been important factors in historians\u2019 evaluations of their records. For example, Wilson\u2019s rather startling efforts to segregate federal offices and the military are becoming more widely known as scholars explore that aspect of his presidency.\n\nHis actions in that regard may overshadow his international idealism, which favored morality over materialism and has been viewed positively. He is no longer considered one of our \u201cgreat\u201d presidents. In Schlesinger Sr.\u2019s 1948 survey, he ranked fourth of 29 presidents. But in 2021, historians ranked him 13th of 45 for C-SPAN.\n\nJackson dropped the most in C-SPAN\u2019s surveys, from 13th in 2000 to 22nd in 2021. His commitment to Indian removal from Southern and Midwestern states, not unique for the time, and the resulting Trail of Tears \u2013 the forced and violent relocation of Native Americans from their homelands \u2013 are important topics in today\u2019s political discussions.\n\nSeveral other presidents who lost ground, including James Polk, Zachary Taylor, Rutherford B. Hayes and Grover Cleveland, were associated with efforts to extend slavery or with failure to protect African Americans following Reconstruction.\n\nThen there is the case of Grant. Ranked at the bottom as a failure in the mid-20th century, he had the largest ranking change of any president in the C-SPAN surveys. He jumped 13 places from 33rd in 2000 to 20th in 2021. He had already moved up from second-to-last place in the 1948 and 1962 Schlesinger surveys to somewhere in the bottom quartile in 2000, to a position in 2021 where more presidents ranked worse than he did.\n\nThe 2021 C-SPAN survey ranks Grant sixth on \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d behind only Lincoln, Lyndon Johnson, Barack Obama, Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter. Given the centrality of equal justice, which may overshadow whatever connection Grant may have had to scandals in his administration, such as Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier and the Whiskey Ring, Grant rises in historians\u2019 overall evaluation.\n\nMoral authority\n\nThis all suggests historians have quite simple ways of evaluating presidents. We have an image of the ideal leader.\n\nPrint Collector/Hulton Archive via Getty Images\n\nJust a few pieces of information relating to that ideal make a big difference in whether we view presidents as fitting or not fitting that image. This is particularly true of our perception of how good they were. Presidents\u2019 moral commitments speak loudly to whether or not we view them as good.\n\nInterestingly, on the quality of \u201cmoral authority\u201d in the C-SPAN surveys from 2000 to 2021, Grant\u2019s ranking rose 14 rungs, from 31st to 17th, even more than it did on \u201cpursued equal justice for all,\u201d where it rose 12 rungs, from 18th to sixth. Wilson and Jackson dropped 13 and 18 places, respectively, on \u201cmoral authority.\u201d\n\nClearly, moral judgments loom large in historians\u2019 assessments of presidential leadership.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to reflect the 2025 transfer of power from President Biden to President Trump.\n\nGeorge R.

That also means extra time to learn the lyrics before the tour\u2026 so no excuses.\u201d\n\nThey gave fans the first taste of their yet-to-be-released third album last summer with the single \u2018No Direction\u2019, marking their first new music since the release of their 2023 album \u2018From Nothing To A Little Bit More\u2019 \u2013 which saw them earn their second Number One LP in the UK album charts \u2013 and their standalone single \u2018Thoughts Of A Child\u2019 which was shared last October.\n\nFrontman Alex Moore said in a press release that recording the LP \u201cfelt like coming full circle\u201d. \u201cWe worked on it with our good friend and old college tutor, John Kettle, which brought us back to our roots. The process felt organic, without the pressure to cater to industry demands, and it allowed us to really explore creatively,\u201d he said.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cIt was like being back in college, free to make music without constraints. Like, [drummer Ryan Durrans] Duz even plays a frying pan in \u2018Stellar Cast\u2019, a random touch you might not expect. Album three is real, raw, and everything we hoped it would be.\u201d\n\nShortly after the album\u2019s release, the band will be heading out on a UK and Ireland tour, set to kick off in Glasgow on March 13. From there, they\u2019ll head to Newcastle, Stoke, Sheffield, London, Belfast, Dublin and more. Then, they\u2019ll wrap things up with a hometown gig at Manchester\u2019s O2 Apollo on April 11.\n\nTickets are on sale now and you can get yours here.\n\nThe Lathums\u2019 2025 UK tour dates are:\n\nMARCH\n\n13 \u2013 Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow\n\n15 \u2013 NX Newcastle, Newcastle\n\n17 \u2013 Victoria Hall, Stoke\n\n18 \u2013 Octagon, Sheffield\n\n20 \u2013 Rock City, Nottingham\n\n21 \u2013 O2 Academy, Birmingham\n\n22 \u2013 O2 Academy Brixton, London\n\n24 \u2013 O2 Guildhall, Southhampton\n\n25 \u2013 SWX, Bristol\n\n27 \u2013 Limelight, Belfast\n\n28 \u2013 The Academy, Dublin\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPRIL\n\n11 \u2013 O2 Apollo, Manchester\n\nThey\u2019re also set to play TRNSMT Festival later this summer, as well as Neighbourhood Weekender.\n\nThe Lathums spoke to NME ahead of the release of their last album \u2018From Nothing To A Little Bit More\u2019 last year. Moore said at the time: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in putting so much into something that you\u2019re not genuinely passionate about? I think it\u2019s quite refreshing that people can see that there\u2019s genuine feelings behind these songs, not like a lot of music that\u2019s out nowadays that\u2019s got no emotion or substance behind it. You can tell those people are singing about what they think people want [to hear]. But I don\u2019t give you what you want: I give you what you need.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s never easy to bid farewell to your childhood idol. When Carlos Alcaraz emotionally thanked Spanish legend Rafael Nadal \u201cfor being an inspiration to all of us,\u201d tears rolled the inner him just to see the 22-time Slam winner drift apart from the sport he gave everything to for nearly two decades. The \u2018King of Clay\u2019 played the final match of his illustrious career representing Spain at the Davis Cup Final 8 in Malaga in November last year. However, since his departure, Alcaraz hasn\u2019t been in contact with him. The reason?\n\nHaving dedicated his life on the court and following a hectic tour-level calendar, naturally, left little to no personal time for Rafa. But, his retirement meant he could now finally reap the rewards of his years-long hard work and, Alcaraz respected that. During a conversation with the Spanish publication, \u2018Sport\u2019, the 21-year-old spoke about his dynamic with the former World No. 1 and acknowledged the well-deserved break relished by Nadal, before commencing his Qatar Open campaign.\n\n\u201cRafa and I have a very good relationship, but I haven\u2019t spoken to him again since he retired from the Davis Cup. I think he deserves to be at peace with his family and enjoying the things that he couldn\u2019t enjoy when he was playing,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has been and is a great role model for me. I have seen that he has congratulated me on social media, but I have not yet had the chance to speak to him. I am sure that the time will come when I can do so.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe former World No. 1, marred with injury concerns ever since sustaining a hip injury at the 2022 Australian Open, struggled to restore his A-game on the tour. Moreover, his valiant effort to clinch a final gold medal for his nation at the Paris Olympics in 2024 also came crashing after he suffered a premature exit at the quadrennial event.\n\nBefore Nadal drew the curtain on his career in front of his home crowd in Malaga, Alcaraz hoped to bid him farewell in the most fitting way. \u201cNo player deserves more to finish the incredible career he had with a title, and I know how special the Davis Cup is for him. It will be a difficult challenge but winning it for Rafa is a huge motivation.\u201d Life post-retirement has been full of business commitments for Rafa.\n\nJust days ago, reports showed fans that the Spanish icon sold nearly half his stake (44.9%) in his \u2018Rafa Nadal Academy\u2019 to a private investment company GPF for a lucrative $100M profit. Moreover, Nadal hasn\u2019t appeared as a spectator at any tennis events since retirement. As for Alcaraz, the 21-year-old has his sights set on the big task.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nCarlos Alcaraz on climbing the ATP ranking ladder \u2013 \u201cNumber one is always a goal\u201d\n\nDoors to claiming the World No. 1 spot were just opened for players. And, that\u2019s an opportunity Spanish superstar Carlos Alcaraz won\u2019t sleep on. The ATP ranking leader, Jannik Sinner, recently accepted a three-month doping suspension from the tour after coming to an agreement with WADA to seal his long-drawn doping controversy.\n\nThe Italian sensation twice tested positive for a banned substance in March last year, drawing acute backlash from the community. However, his absence means that arch-rival Alcaraz can regain his lost spot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nTalking in the same interview, Alcaraz, although refrained from talking about Sinner\u2019s doping saga \u2013 \u201cThe truth is little to say. Whether it is or not, it does not influence us. We remain focused on ours and our goals\u201d \u2013 talked about reclaiming the World No. 1 spot. \u201cThe number one is always a goal. As I say, that it\u2019s not there doesn\u2019t change anything for us. We try to improve in our own and focus on continuing to work to reach number one.\u201d\n\nAlcaraz will next take to the court on Monday, February 17. The top-seeded player is slated to lock horns with Marin Cilic in the Middle Eastern event\u2019s Round of 32."

Highlights include:\n\nInstallation of a hillside lift from Europe Square up to the cave entrance, making it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors.\n\nfrom Europe Square up to the cave entrance, making it accessible for mobility-impaired visitors.

The Central Archaeological Council has waved through the plans, while Development Organization \u201cDaedalos SA\u201d is handling the heavy lifting (figuratively\u2014for now). The Ministry of Culture threw \u20ac16 million from recovery fund money into the works. However, the cave is still\u2026 well, very closed.\n\nMythology Meets Red Tape\n\nBack in September 2024, Greece\u2019s Culture Minister, Lina Mendoni, took the mic to remind everyone of the cave\u2019s rich heritage and, naturally, to address the why-is-this-taking-so-long crowd. \u201cThis is a globally significant site tied to legends of Zeus and Europe\u2019s sneaky seduction under a plane tree.\u201d Sounds lovely, doesn\u2019t it? Except for one little snag: the area is practically impossible to reach for anyone not in peak physical condition or those requiring specialized access.\n\nMendoni waxed poetic about the cave\u2019s potential after the upgrades\u2014calling it an \u201cirreplaceable cultural asset\u201d once the lift is installed. Until then, let\u2019s be honest: it\u2019s just eye sore standing behind no-entry tape.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s promised when the changes are completed:\n\nImproved accessibility for all, in line with a \u201cuniversal access\u201d initiative.\n\nConservation work to return the cave to its former Neolithic-era glory.\n\nA safer, modernized space offering a comfortable journey to explore its historical depth (finally).\n\nFor now, though, visitors can look forward to hiking busted trails while squinting at posted signs stating, \u201crenovations in progress.\u201d"
