The game sends the signal that the tide might be turning once more.\n\nWhile Bueckers will likely rise a few more spots on that scoring list before she leaves Storrs, she\u2019s got some work to do to catch up with Lobo in some other categories. Specifically, Lobo led the 1995 Huskies to an undefeated national title in 1995, winning almost every player of the year award."

        "content": "In the UFC world, there\u2019s always that one fight which proves to be elusive enough to keep fans on the edge. Previously, it was Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Tony Ferguson, which, heartbreakingly didn\u2019t come into fruition, despite being booked five times. However, in that situation, both fighters actually wanted to face each other, without fear of losing and wanting to prove once and for all who the better fighter was. Now, we have a similar fight, except this time, two things are different. One, it\u2019s a veteran vs. up-and-comer fight. Two, one of these fighters is reluctant to face the other. We\u2019re talking about Jon Jones vs. Tom Aspinall, of course.\n\nMeanwhile, frustration among fans has boiled over into outright hostility, with many accusing the MMA legend of dodging the new wave of challengers\u2014especially the dangerous Brit waiting in the wings. According to featherweight champion Ilia Topuria, however, the fight will definitely happen. \u2018El Matador\u2019 recently sat down for a chat on the Full Send podcast and shared his honest opinion on the whole scenario. For a potential fight with Aspinall, \u2018Bones\u2019 wants \u201cf**k you money\u201d and Topuria feels he deserves to get paid big money.\n\nDuring the interview, the host of the show asked the champion, \u201cYou think the Jon Jones versus Aspinall fight happens?\u201d Topuria had no hesitation in saying, \u201cFor sure\u201d. He then pointed out that \u2018Bones\u2019 is correct in asking big money for his fight and that the UFC should oblige him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHe said, \u201cHe don\u2019t need to fight anymore you know. If he fights, he\u2019s honest, like, \u2018This is what I need to go inside that Octagon and put the performance you want from my side. If you are willing to pay me just pay me. If not god bless you we\u2019re all good\u2019. \u201d As fans, we can only hope that the UFC is doing everything in their power to make this fight happen. After all, Dana White did say that this would be \u201cthe biggest fight in UFC history\u201d, if it happened.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Full Send Podcast (@fullsendpodcast)\n\nEarlier this month, the Albuquerque native stirred excitement by teasing his \u201cnext fight.\u201d But when the reveal came, it wasn\u2019t the long-awaited showdown fans had hoped for\u2014instead, it was a campaign about the \u201chealth care system\u201d, advocating for patient rights for a non-profit organization. But that doesn\u2019t mean Jones isn\u2019t warm to the idea of facing Aspinall. We\u2019re saying this because of a certain reaction Jones gave about a certain fight announcement. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nJon Jones likes the idea of him fighting Tom Aspinall next in his career\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe heavyweight division is stuck in limbo, and at the center of it all is Jon Jones\u2014a man who knows how to keep the MMA world hanging on his every word. However, UFC CEO Dana White is confident that he can pull off what could be a super fight in the heavyweight division.\n\nThe most recent official update came last month when the 55-year-old said, \u201cOne hundred percent, if we don\u2019t get the fight done, we move on and make another fight\u2026We\u2019re working on lots of stuff right now. There\u2019s lots of really good sh*t going on right now. There\u2019s no situation. It\u2019s the biggest fight we can make.\u201d Although the last official word from the UFC was vague, an Instagram MMA page called Elusive Combat has now hinted at a possible announcement.\n\nThe message read, \u201cBreaking: Jon Jones vs. Tom Aspinall is in the works for UFC 317 during International Fight Week.\u201d The source mentioned Dana White, but there is a lot of doubt surrounding the post. However, Jones caught the attention of the post and commented, \u201cHow cool would that be?\u201d\u2014which has now added more fuel to the ongoing speculation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nAs far as the UFC 317 event is concerned it is reported that it will take place on June 28 at the T-Mobile Arena in Nevada. The heavyweight champion has once kept the fans on their toes with his latest comment. It will now be interesting to see whether the UFC can make the fight between these two happen or not.\n\nDo you think Jon Jones will fight Tom Aspinall next in his career? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below."

        "content": "From now until the 2025 NFL Draft, we will scout and create profiles for as many prospects as possible, examining their strengths, weaknesses, and what they can bring to an NFL franchise. These players could be potential top 10 picks, down to Day 3 selections, and priority undrafted free agents. Today, a scouting report on Marshall EDGE Mike Green.\n\n#15 MIKE GREEN/EDGE MARSHALL \u2013 6031, 251 POUNDS (R-SOPHOMORE)\n\nPlayer Ht/Wt Hand Size Arm Length Wingspan Mike Green 6031/251 8 5/8 32 1/4 77 1/4 40-Yard Dash 10-Yard Dash Short Shuttle 3-Cone N/A N/A N/A N/A Broad Jump Vertical Bench Press N/A N/A N/A\n\nGood\n\n\u2013 Major uptick in production for his final season in college\n\n\u2013 Has a nice swim move in his arsenal that he uses in both the run and pass game\n\n\u2013 Uses his quickness along with finesse to make the tackle use false steps and blow by them\n\n\u2013 Patient and disciplined defender who will stay put and contain backside in case of a running back cuts back to his side\n\n\u2013 Uses a lot of pre-snap movement to confuse the offensive linemen on which gap he will be attacking\n\n\u2013 Has really solid game speed\n\n\u2013 Due to skill set, would be effective on stunts\n\n\u2013 Good bend to get past tackles\n\n\u2013 Handles double teams surprisingly well\n\n\u2013 High ceiling, especially if he puts on some more weight to use power more often\n\nBad\n\n\u2013 Limited experience with only having one college season of starting playing time\n\n\u2013 Handful of times on tape will not take a direct path to the ball carrier but instead, use false steps as if he is thinking too much about where the ball is heading when he should just play off instincts\n\n\u2013 Linemen have a pretty easy time throwing him out of the play if he chooses a shoulder to attack\n\n\u2013 Finishing plays seems to be an issue at times, which can be due to over-pursuing\n\n\u2013 Needs to incorporate power more into his rush attempts\n\n\u2013 Looks lost when they drop him into coverage\n\n\u2013 Allows linemen to get inside hands on him, which neutralizes his rush\n\n\u2013 Played in the Sun Belt with an easy schedule\n\nBio\n\n\u2013 Six games played for Virginia in 2021 and 26 games played for Marshall from 2023 to 2024\n\n\u2013 131 tackles, 22.5 sacks, four forced fumbles, and 33 tackles for loss in his college career\n\n\u2013 84 tackles, 17 sacks, three forced fumbles, and 23 tackles for loss in 2024\n\n\u2013 No notable injuries\n\n\u2013 Three-star ATH in his 2021 high school class from Williamsburg, VA\n\n\u2013 Finished second in Virginia in state wrestling as a sophomore and third as a junior\n\n\u2013 Played linebacker and tight end in high school but did not play in the 2020 season\n\n\u2013 Played no games for Virginia in 2022, entered the transfer portal following that season\n\n\u2013 In 2024, led the FBS in sacks (17.0), sack yardage (144), tackles for loss (22.5), TFL yardage (155), and tackles by a defensive lineman (84).\n\n\u2013 2024 First Team All-American, 2024 Sun Belt Player of the Year, and 2024 First-team All-Sun Belt\n\nTape Breakdown\n\nMike Green needed a strong Senior Bowl performance to prove to scouts that he wasn\u2019t just a one-year wonder. He did exactly that and more, exceeding expectations with a dominant showing, highlighted by a play where he overpowered Oregon offensive tackle Josh Conerly. Conerly, projected as a late first to early second-round pick, found himself on his back, a testament to Green\u2019s power and explosiveness. After making his mark on this play, Green withdrew from the Senior Bowl and shifted his focus to NFL Draft preparation.\n\nI have watched Mike Green run through Josh Conerly 100 times pic.twitter.com/iaZK56hDen \u2014 Big Game Bengal (@BengalYouTube) January 29, 2025\n\nEven though I don\u2019t see Green play with that same strength in a normal game, he sometimes flashes solid power. Here, against Southern Miss, he blows up a pulling guard that then gets in the way of the running backs\u2019 path. Green single-handedly blew up this entire run play by overpowering the guard and clogging the lane. This is what I wanted to see more consistently from him.\n\nYou\u2019ll see a lot from Green, a decent amount of pre-snap movement, and then some misdirection with a swim to blow past the offensive tackle. Very subtly, in this play, Green takes a step or two towards the B-gap that he is lined up in front of before crossing the tackle\u2019s face and hitting his right shoulder with a swim. That subtle move gets the tackle moving left while Green uses his great game speed to blow by him. This has worked all season for Green, with offensive tackles having no answer.\n\nEven though Green doesn\u2019t use a spin as often as he uses his swim, it can be just as impactful. My favorite example of Green executing the spin came against Ohio State on this play. He closes the space and then starts moving in towards the tackle\u2019s left shoulder before spinning back out to the tackle\u2019s right side and blowing past him with, once again, that great game speed. Doing this is impressive, but pulling it out against the hardest team you face all season makes it even better.\n\nFinally, I want to mention Green\u2019s ability to handle double teams. He has been shockingly successful against them, as shown by the tape I watched. Given his undersized frame, I did not expect this. Here, he attacks the B-gap and powers through even with the help coming halfway through the rep. He has plays like this in multiple of the games I watched. His strength may not come up on tape by throwing a tackle on their back, but it shows up on plays like this, where he fights through contact from two offensive linemen.\n\nConclusion\n\nMike Green is a guy who has a noticeable chip on his shoulder. From being a three-star high school prospect and not playing much at Virginia to leading the nation in sacks and tackles for loss in 2024, Green has shot up draft boards like crazy. On tape, he shows good overall versatility, doing everything at least at a solid enough level. There are things he can refine, like his run-stopping ability with two-gapping or his ability to finish plays by not over-pursuing.\n\nHowever, his deep array of moves to rush the passer and his overall discipline are a great base for a defensive coordinator to work with. Some may question Green due to his lack of size, withdrawing himself from the Senior Bowl early, and playing in a weaker conference, but I feel he has done enough to warrant a high draft pick.\n\nMy player comparison for Mike Green is Alex Highsmith. Size-wise, their height, weight, hand size, and arm length are all around the same. Both struggled to get playing time in college before their second to last year, when they became impact players. Also, both had explosive final college seasons, where they led at least their conference in tackles for loss or sacks, if not the entire FBS.\n\nWhen looking at their play styles, you\u2019ll see both of them be smart and disciplined by sealing the backside in case there is a cutback to them in the run game. When watching both, I think they are about on the same level when it comes to their spins and bendability. If Mike Green goes to a team with another certified star rushing from the other side, don\u2019t be surprised if Green puts up a 14.5 sack season like Highsmith did in his breakout 2022 season.\n\nProjection: Mid to Late Day One\n\nDepot Draft Grade: 8.4 \u2013 Second Round (Future Quality Starter)\n\nGames Watched: Senior Bowl (2025), Southern Miss (2024), Virginia Tech (2024), Louisiana-Monroe (2024), Louisiana (2024)"

        "content": "Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers aren\u2019t just changing the game on the court\u2014they\u2019re rewriting the playbook for athlete branding and marketing. Reese recently secured a deal with Reebok where she has her own signature shoe ready set ready to be launched in 2026. She also collaborated with McDonald\u2019s for an Angel Reese Special meal, making her the first female athlete to get a national meal endorsement by the company. Her partnership further extends to brands like Goldman Sachs, Beats by Dre, Tampax, Airbnb, Amazon, PlayStation and more.\n\nOn the other hand, Bueckers trademarked her nickname \u201cPaige Buckets\u201d in 2021, showcasing her sharp acumen in personal branding. Furthermore, she designed her own player edition sneaker with Nike. The Nike G.T. Hustle 3 is the first Nike Player Edition shoe celebrating an NIL athlete. She further has partnerships with brands like Topps, Dunkin\u2019, UConn NIL Store, Leaf Trading Cards, and more. These two stars are prime examples of how to build a personal brand that resonates with your story.\n\nIn the first episode of our EssentiallySports\u2013Think Tank Season 2 podcast, our host, Trey Holder, and Jack Adler, the founder of Out2Win sparked a conversation about how marketable the duo is. Emery Barnes, Marketing, Brand & Creative at DoorDash emphasized how crucial it is for athletes to have a brand identity. Barnes recalled a conversation with one of his clients. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, you\u2019ve got to have a brand, whether you\u2019re an athlete or an entertainer,\u201d quipped Barnes based on his conversation with the client. Gone are the days when you would be selected based on your performance. Barnes summarised that it\u2019s no longer just about performance; it\u2019s about fan engagement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nBeyond Endorsements: How Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers are Redefining Athlete Branding\n\nBarnes believes that the introduction of NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) deals, has completely changed the game. College athletes can now earn money from endorsements and sponsorship, something which was prohibited. However, Barnes believes that despite this brilliant opportunity, most of the advertisements and campaigns are just bland and generic. This is an area where Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers have stood out from the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to follow the script precisely. Talk about all our key messaging points, but do it in a way that\u2019s authentic to you and your audience,\u201d Barnes advised.\n\nDoorDash\u2019s marketing team used Anthony Edwards as an example of how his larger-than-life personality fueled his rise. Surely, \u201che talks s**t but he backs it up,\u201d Barnes quipped. He has amassed unfathomable success by being himself. His $50 million partnership with Adidas and the Sprite deal are testament to that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nEmery Barnes believes that Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers are doing something similar. Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reebok\u2019s president, kicked off his athlete roster by signing Reese in 2023. Together with Reebok, Bayou Barbie wants to inspire people to \u201cexpress themselves unapologetically and look good while doing it.\u201d Bueckers\u2019 personal shoe by Nike features a personal message from her father and pays tribute to both of her homes.\n\nThe female duo is not only selling products but is turning their personal stories into something bigger. They are sharing part of their lives, making the fans feel involved in their personal journey. While women\u2019s sport is on an upward trajectory, it still lags behind in terms of marketing opportunities. Campaigns like these showcase what needs to be done to bridge that gap.\n\nDoorDash\u2019s creative believes that the narrative around athletes has changed. It\u2019s not just about performance anymore, \u201cit\u2019s important to market yourself as an athlete and just think about what is the story you are gonna tell,\u201d claimed Barnes. And it looks like Reese and Bueckers are at the forefront of this revolution. They are not only making themselves bigger but are showcasing how personal branding can foster meaningful connections. This reflects the ThinkTank initiative of creating a brand that will influence the future of sports content by cultivating connections between athletes, fans, and brands.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThink Tank is a premium initiative of EssentiallySports that brings together the brightest minds to discuss strategy, leadership, change, and opportunities in the world of sports content business.

He should not forget that thousands of Congress and UDF workers toiled day and night for his victories. In a few months, these grassroots workers will be contesting the local body elections. At the very least, the MP should have considered the negative impact his comments could have on the victory prospects of these workers,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday that the startup sector has experienced significant growth during the LDF government's tenure.\n\nOver the past eight years, the number of startups has risen to 6200, creating approximately 60,000 jobs and attracting investments worth Rs 5,800 crore.\n\nIn 2016, the available business space was just 15,000 square feet, but now Kerala boasts more than 10 lakh sq feet of incubation space. The government has set a target of achieving 15,000 startups by 2026, which is expected to create 1 lakh job opportunities.\n\nThe chief minister's comments are particularly significant in the wake of Shashi Tharoor's praise for the Kerala government's start-up policy. Thiruvananthapuram has faced criticism from his party for commending the LDF government's achievements."
