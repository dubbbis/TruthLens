Hawkins\nFeb 14, 2025, 3:04 PM UTC\nAndrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nProtestors are planning more demonstrations outside Tesla showrooms nationwide this weekend, as Elon Musk\u2019s polarizing behavior and political activities within the Trump administration continue to have negative side effects on his electric car business.\nThe protests are being advertised on BlueSky under the tags \u201cTesla Takeover\u201d and \u201cTesla Takedown,\u201d similar to demonstrations held last weekend. At least three dozen events are listed on Action Network\u2019s website, with a banner urging people who own Tesla vehicles or stock in the company to divest, sell their vehicle, and \u201cjoin the picket line.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people will join the demonstrations, and whether there is even a clear leader behind the movement. Alex Winter, a progressive activist and actor who played Bill in Bill and Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure, posted about it on BlueSky.\nStill, it\u2019s a sign that Musk\u2019s company as well as the millions of vehicles that he has sold continue to serve as a target for people angry and frustrated by the unelected billionaire\u2019s efforts to take over the federal government at Trump\u2019s behest, shutting down whole agencies and targeting federal workers for layoffs.\nIt has led to vandalism in some cases. Social media is rife with images of Tesla vehicles defaced with swastikas or slapped with stickers of Musk throwing a fascist salute at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Earlier this month, police in Arcata, Cali., received several reports of Tesla owners finding threatening notes on their cars, warning them to sell their cars or risk the consequences. \u201cNo Nazis in America,\u201d several of the fliers read, according to local reports.\nSeveral Tesla shareholders have expressed a desire for a change in leadership at the company, worried that Musk\u2019s growing polarizing reputation could significantly impact the company\u2019s financial future. But that seems unlikely in the near term, given Musk\u2019s broad shareholder support. Still, Tesla\u2019s stock price has plummeted 30 percent from its all-time high in December, including a 21 percent selloff since Trump\u2019s inauguration, ABC reports. Tesla sales were down year over year in 2024 for the first time in over a decade. And the company appears to be in free fall in Europe, plummeting in several key markets like Norway, France, and Spain, Wired found.\nFor years, Tesla\u2019s fortunes have been inextricably linked to attitudes toward its controversial CEO. When people thought Musk was going to usher in a brighter future, full of robotaxis and trips to Mars, the value of the company went up like one of his rocket ships. But now that he\u2019s being labeled a fascist while leading a shadowy effort to root out \u201cDEI\u201d and \u201cwoke ideology\u201d in the federal government, Musk is becoming more of a liability than an asset.\nSee More:\nCars\nElectric Cars\nElon Musk\nNews\nPolicy\nTech\nTesla\nTranspo\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nThe next Xbox is going to be very different\nFinal Fantasy iOS game shuts down over unfixable bug\nApple\u2019s sci-fi movies are way behind its shows\nTim Cook teases a new Apple launch next week, and it\u2019s probably the iPhone SE\nElon Musk\u2019s DOGE website has been defaced because anyone can edit it\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad\nMore in News\nNetflix finally decides to play nice and support the Apple TV app\nTrump\u2019s first 100 days: all the news affecting the tech industry\nOpen-source code repository says \u2018far-right forces\u2019 are behind massive spam attacks\nElon Musk\u2019s DOGE website has been defaced because anyone can edit it\nMicrosoft Outlook\u2019s new minimize button makes mobile emails much easier\nThe entire story of Twitter / X under Elon Musk\nNetflix finally decides to play nice and support the Apple TV app\nJess WeatherbedAn hour ago\nTrump\u2019s first 100 days: all the news affecting the tech industry\nVerge StaffAn hour ago\nOpen-source code repository says \u2018far-right forces\u2019 are behind massive spam attacks\nDominic PrestonTwo hours ago\nElon Musk\u2019s DOGE website has been defaced because anyone can edit it\nJess Weatherbed11:05 AM UTC\nMicrosoft Outlook\u2019s new minimize button makes mobile emails much easier\nTom Warren10:54 AM UTC\nThe entire story of Twitter / X under Elon Musk\nVerge Staff4:09 AM UTC\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad\nTop Stories\nAn hour ago\nThe technology team at financial regulator CFPB has been gutted\nAn hour ago\nNetflix finally decides to play nice and support the Apple TV app\nTwo hours ago\nElden Ring Nightreign\u2019s director isn\u2019t sorry about how stressful it is\n11:05 AM UTC\nElon Musk\u2019s DOGE website has been defaced because anyone can edit it\nFeb 13\nCaptain America: Brave New World is trying twice as hard to be half as good\nFeb 13\nThe next Xbox is going to be very different"
