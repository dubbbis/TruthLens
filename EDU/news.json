        "content": "While generative artificial intelligence technology continues to advance at incredible speed, organisational change has been hard work, and a majority of executives believe their experiments with the technology will not be fully scaled in the coming months.\n\nAccording to a recent Deloitte report, more than two-thirds of respondents said that 30% or fewer of their experiments will be fully scaled in the next three to six months. Despite longer than expected time to value, nearly three-quarters of respondents also reported that their most advanced gen AI initiative is meeting or exceeding ROI expectations. Cybersecurity and IT functions are leading the way in terms of ROI and successful scaling.\n\nWhile agentic AI is seen as a key enabler of sustainable value, regulatory uncertainty and risk management remain key barriers, the report\u2014 based on a survey of 2,773 director- to C-suite-level respondents across 14 countries\u2014noted."

        "content": "**This image is for use with this specific article only** Mules are helping deliver supplies to North Carolina residents devastated by Hurricane Helene, according to Mountain Mule Packer Ranch. Photo credit: Mountain Mule Packer Ranch via CNN Newsource Dateline: Mount Ulla, North Carolina.\n\nAmong the idyllic landscapes of Mount Ulla, North Carolina, there is a sadness wafting through the community where two mules and a horse that carried supplies to victims of Hurricane Helene were hit and killed last weekend.\n\nThe three animals, named Vader, Kev and Amigo, were struck by a semitruck on a road. A tree fell on a fence, leaving an opening for the three faithful equines to escape their pasture, according to a post on the Mountain Mule Packer Ranch Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe could not be more heartbroken over this incredible loss, and it is with great pain that we share it with you, as we know many of you have also fallen in love with these sweet animals,\u201d the ranch said in the post.\n\nThe packs of mules trekked through treacherous roadways and rocky mountain sides to deliver food, water and building supplies to those devastated by the hurricane. The mules helped deliver disaster relief from western North Carolina to eastern Tennessee, the ranch said on social media.\n\nThe organization\u2019s mission is to provide mule training and packing instruction for civilian and military groups. The animals are equipped to carry gear and resources for weapon groups, communication teams and medical teams in remote environments, according to the ranch.\n\nThe hard work of these mules and their tireless efforts united the community after the tragedy of Hurricane Helene, Mountain Mule Packers\u2019 co-founder Michele Toberer said. Since the devastating cyclone hit Appalachia in September, the mules have played an integral part in relief efforts, especially in areas inaccessible by vehicles, the animals\u2019 owner said.\n\nHurricane Helene was a Category 4 storm that created a 500-mile path of destruction from Florida to North Carolina with catastrophic flooding, damaging winds and power outages. Helene is one of the costliest tropical cyclones to ever hit the United States, resulting in nearly $80 billion in damage. At least 106 people were killed as a result of the storm, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn November, the ranch created a Christian non-profit disaster response organization known as Mission Mules to continue hurricane relief. The community was unified by their work in a beautiful way, Toberer explained.\n\n\u201cThey brought more than just supplies to people. It\u2019s that they were bringing hope to people, because there were so many people that felt like they were forgotten,\u201d Toberer said. \u201cJust the fact that these mules were coming brought a smile to their face.\u201d\n\nDespite this tragic loss, the disaster relief organization pushes forward with its mission. The team and its mules are hosting a distribution event in Black Mountain, North Carolina for those continuing to be impacted by Helene\u2019s aftermath.\n\n\u201cThe thought of leaving on Saturday without the other three is already heartbreaking for us, so we\u2019re preparing ourselves for that,\u201d Toberer said. \u201cTheir work ethic and what they\u2019ve done with the people in western North Carolina taught us in the last few months that when something unimaginable happens, we still keep going.\u201d\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "content": "The usual operator for the Lavrio-Agios Efstratios-Lemnos-Kavala line bailed on their responsibilities. They didn\u2019t show up to renew their contract properly, leaving the Ministry of Shipping scrambling for solutions. It gets sketchier. When the Ministry opened a public call for substitutes, the market shrugged. Ships were available partially but not for the entire route. Smooth planning? Forget it.\n\nOn top of this supply chain drama, a court case muddied the waters. A claim landed at the Council of State, halting plans for the permanent line. Everyone\u2019s on hold, waiting for the decision. Cue corporate lawyers popping champagne while commuters grind their teeth. Until then, the Ministry greenlit stopgap measures and a series of \u201cnew special routes\u201d to keep things moving, sort of.\n\nThe Patchwork Schedule\n\nSo here\u2019s the plan\u2014grab your calendars and maybe a shot of ouzo:\n\nBlue Star Chios and Blue Star Mykonos will spice up their Tuesday runs from Mytilene. Starting February 18, 2025, they\u2019ll swing by Agios Efstratios, hit Lemnos, and dock at Kavala on Wednesday.\n\nwill spice up their Tuesday runs from Mytilene. Starting February 18, 2025, they\u2019ll swing by Agios Efstratios, hit Lemnos, and dock at Kavala on Wednesday. Nisos Samos steps up for Saturday service from Mytilene to Lemnos and Kavala on February 22, 2025, with a return trip on Sunday.

If it gets busy, this ride could stick around on Saturdays. RoRo Talos will tackle a marathon route from Piraeus to Ikaria, Samos, Chios, Mytilene, Lemnos, and Kavala for heavy-duty logistics. This happens February 17\u201321, 2025. Think of it as the grand tour of the Aegean.\n\nwill tackle a marathon route from Piraeus to Ikaria, Samos, Chios, Mytilene, Lemnos, and Kavala for heavy-duty logistics. This happens February 17\u201321, 2025. Think of it as the grand tour of the Aegean. Thalassitis rounds out the lineup with weekly trips from Piraeus to Chios, Mytilene, Lemnos, and either Thessaloniki or Kavala.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Is Kavala being dropped temporarily from the Lavrio route? Purely provisional. Once the legal dust settles, expect the Lavrio-Agios Efstratios-Lemnos-Kavala flow to resume its groove. Kavala\u2019s a non-negotiable connection point for the Ministry; there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Islands?\n\nIsland mayors and MPs recently huddled with the Minister to hash out a master plan. The goal? Stability. By 2029, multi-year contracts (four-year minimum) will put sturdier ships into play. Hooray for fewer delays and better passenger seats\u2014or so we hope. Plus, higher funding incentives aim to attract newer vessels for 2025-2029. It\u2019s about time, right?\n\nMeanwhile, the Lemnos-Alexandroupoli line via Samothraki continues to thrive every summer from June 2 to August 31. This backup option has low-key become a rising star. Lemnos fans might consider booking sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTo call the Lavrio-Agios Efstratios-Lemnos-Kavala disruptions a headache would be putting it mildly. The Ministry is shaking up schedules to patch things up until permanent solutions can sail in\u2014literally. If you\u2019ve got travel plans, keep checking schedules, and maybe keep an eye on that Council of State decision. For now, buckle up (or, well, dock your boat) and ride it out.\n\nFor official updates, visit the Ministry of Shipping\u2019s Official Page."

        "content": "Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) are two prominent choices for individuals seeking long-term savings and wealth creation. Both investment options offer distinct advantages, catering to different risk appetites and financial goals. This article compares SIP and PPF returns for an annual investment of Rs 1.3 lakh to determine which can generate a larger corpus.\n\nSIP: Market-Linked Growth with Potentially High Returns\n\nSIPs involve disciplined investments in mutual funds, where a fixed amount is debited regularly from the investor\u2019s account. While SIPs offer the potential for substantial returns, they are subject to market volatility and risks.\n\nHow SIP Works:\n\nFixed amounts are invested periodically, allowing for disciplined savings.\n\nReturns are influenced by the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the selected mutual fund.\n\nCompounding and market growth over time amplify returns.\n\nExample: SIP Returns\n\nMonthly Investment: Rs 10,850\n\nTotal Invested Amount: Rs 19,53,000\n\nTotal Interest Earned: Rs 35,21,650\n\nMaturity Value: Rs 54,74,650\n\nSIPs, driven by market performance, can yield a robust corpus, ideal for investors comfortable with market risks.\n\nPPF: Government-Backed Security and Steady Growth\n\nPPF is a low-risk investment option, offering guaranteed returns and tax benefits. Backed by the government, it\u2019s suited for risk-averse individuals seeking a stable saving tool.\n\nKey Features of PPF:\n\nInterest Rate: 7.1% per annum (compounded annually).\n\nLock-in Period: 15 years, extendable in 5-year blocks.\n\nAnnual Investment Limit: Rs 500 to Rs 1.5 lakh.\n\nExample: PPF Returns\n\nTotal Invested Amount: Rs 19,50,000\n\nTotal Interest Earned: Rs 15,75,781\n\nMaturity Value: Rs 35,25,781\n\nPPF offers security and tax-free returns, albeit with a lower growth trajectory compared to SIPs.\n\nSIP vs PPF: The Key Takeaway\n\nHigher Returns : SIPs have the potential for a larger corpus but involve market-linked risks.\n\n: SIPs have the potential for a larger corpus but involve market-linked risks. Secure Growth: PPF ensures safety and steady returns, ideal for conservative investors.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFor those willing to embrace market risks, SIPs can generate a higher corpus over time.\n\nFor individuals prioritizing safety and tax efficiency, PPF is a more secure choice.\n\nDisclaimer: This comparison is for informational purposes. Investment decisions should align with individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon."
