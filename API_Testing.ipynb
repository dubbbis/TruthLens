Next, explain what the above phrase means to them.\\nThen read their lists and explain what the above labels mean to them. Finally knowing how small and intimate these definitions are, read them aloud.\\nWhen you speak of definitions, if for no other reason than that they generally require clarifying context, indicate precisely where you got this idea from. After read the discussion points, stop and explain what’s really important about listening: That we enjoy being a listener.\\nHints on listening When writing is prolonged and we’re being lectured, we need to orient ourselves by making generalizations about the other people.
