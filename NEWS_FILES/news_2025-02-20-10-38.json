Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes. “The heart of an entire nation breaks,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday in anticipation of the bodies being returned to Israel. Israel and Hamas have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult phase of the ceasefire, and the first ends in early March. Palestinians and Arab countries have universally rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to remove the Palestinian population from Gaza and take over the territory. Since the war in Gaza began, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon. Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack. ___ Here’s the latest: Hamas begins handover of remains of 4 Israeli hostages Hamas militants displayed four black coffins on a stage surrounded by militant banners ahead of the handover Thursday of hostages’ remains. Red Cross vehicles were present at the scene to accept the bodies and return them to Israel. The handover is part of a ceasefire that paused Israel’s 15-month military offensive in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. ▶ Read more about the ceasefire in Gaza.

        "content": "myMotherLode.com - The Mother Lode's Local News, Sports, Weather, Movies, Classifieds, Yellow Pages, Real Estate Who are the hostages freed by Hamas as part of the ceasefire in Gaza? JERUSALEM (AP) — The bodies of four Israelis taken captive by Hamas, including those said to be of the last female and child hostages in Gaza, were released Thursday, bringing to 28 the number of captives freed since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Jan. 19. The bodies returned to Israel are presumed to include Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose plight has captivated Israelis since they were taken during Hamas’ deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023. The body of one of the oldest hostages held was also said to have been returned. The remains now need to be formally identified. In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, a total of 33 hostages in Gaza — eight of whom are dead — are supposed to be freed in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Five Thai citizens who were working in Israel on the day of the attack were freed last month as part of a separate deal. Hamas-led militants took 251 hostages during their Oct. 7, 2023, attack that launched the war in Gaza. More than 60 hostages remain in Gaza, although about half are believed to be dead. The others were released, rescued, or their bodies recovered. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says more than half were women or children. Here’s a look at the hostages returned so far: Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas The bodies said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, were returned Thursday. They were abducted along with Shiri’s husband, Yarden, from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas said the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Yarden Bibas was released earlier this month during the ceasefire deal. A video capturing their abduction showed a terrified Shiri Bibas swaddling her two redheaded sons in a blanket and being carried away by militants. The footage ricocheted around the world in the hours after the attack began. Ariel was 4 years old at the time of the attack and his brother, Kfir, was 9 months old, making him the youngest captive taken by Hamas. Ariel Bibas loved Batman and family photos showed the four Bibases dressed as the character. Kfir, the infant with red hair and a toothless smile, became a symbol across Israel for the feelings of helplessness and anger over the hostages’ captivity. Oded Lifshitz, 84 The body said to be of Oded Lifshitz, one of the oldest hostages held by the militants, was returned Thursday. He was taken captive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded Lifshitz was shot in the hand in the attack. His family has suspected for months that he died in captivity. The couple are among the founders of Nir Oz. Oded, a journalist, campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. In retirement, he drove to the Erez border crossing on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip once a week to ferry Palestinians to medical appointments in Israel as part of a group called On the Way to Recovery. Oded took pride in his work helping the traditionally nomadic Bedouin people of the Negev Desert, his daughter told The Associated Press, describing a case that went to Israel’s High Court and resulted in the return of some of their land. Sagui Dekel Chen, 36 An Israeli-American, Chen was working outside on his pet project, bus conversions, when militants stormed his kibbutz. He instructed his wife, Avital, to hide in the safe room with their two daughters. Chen, one of the first people to raise alarm of the infiltration on the kibbutz, was taken captive. Avital was seven months pregnant at the time of the attack; she gave birth to a third daughter, Shachar Mazal, in December 2023. Chen is an avid tennis player who co-founded an arts center for young people in southern Israel, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group representing the families of hostages, Iair Horn, 46 Horn is an Israel-Argentinian who was taken captive along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who was staying with him at the time. Eitan Horn remains in captivity and his name is not on the list of hostages to be released during the ceasefire’s first phase. Iair Horn managed the kibbutz pub and is a fan of the local soccer team in Beer Sheba, according to the hostages forum. Friends gathered at the kibbutz pub on Nir Oz to watch Horn’s release from captivity and to toast his return, according to Israeli media. Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29 Sasha Trufanov, an Israeli-Russian, was taken hostage along with three members of his family: grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and girlfriend Sapir Cohen. His father, Vitaly Trufanov, was killed on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest of his family was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Sasha Troufanov works as an engineer for Amazon, according to the hostages forum. His family immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union 25 years ago. He was believed to be held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza, which has released multiple videos of him in captivity, including one just hours before his release. Eli Sharabi, 52 Eli Sharabi was taken captive by the militants from Kibbutz Beeri, a communal farm that was one of the hardest hit in the Hamas attack. His British-born wife, Lianne, and their teenage daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were killed by militants while hiding in their safe room. His brother, Yossi Sharabi, who lived next door, was killed in captivity. Hamas militants are holding his body, according to the Hostages Forum. Eli Sharabi’s home bore marks from the attack months later. AP journalists saw bullet holes in the walls and the shattered oven and TV screens. Nearby homes were torched by militants and their roofs blasted off during fighting on Oct. 7. Ohad Ben Ami, 56 Ohad Ben Ami, a father to three, was taken captive with his wife, Raz, from Kibbutz Beeri, where he was an accountant.

Goldberg-Polin, whose parents staged a high-profile campaign for his release, was killed in Hamas captivity. Or Levy is from the city of Rishon Lezion, where he worked as a computer programmer for a startup. Yarden Bibas, 35 The release of Yarden Bibas dimmed hopes that his wife and children were still alive in Gaza. Hamas has claimed that the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel has not confirmed that, but a military spokesperson said last month that the government was “extremely concerned” about their welfare. Yarden Bibas was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7. Photos from the abduction show him wounded, bleeding from the head. Keith Siegel, 65 Keith Siegel, from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was abducted with his wife, Aviva Siegel, from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, a communal farming village heavily damaged by the attack. She was freed during the November 2023 ceasefire deal, and has campaigned across the world for the release of her husband and other hostages. Aviva Siegel said that she was held hostage with her husband during her 51 days in captivity. She said she took comfort from having her husband by her side as they were moved from tunnel to tunnel, the two given almost no food or water. Her parting words to him were, “Be strong for me.” Ofer Kalderon, 54 Ofer Kalderon, a French-Israeli hostage, was taken captive from Kibbutz Nir Oz. His teenage children, Sahar and Erez, were also abducted, but they were freed during the weeklong ceasefire in 2023.

Agam Berger, 20 In videos of Agam Berger’s abduction, her face is covered in blood, though it’ unclear if it is from her own wound or those of other soldiers. Berger is a violin player from a suburb of Tel Aviv who enlisted in the army just two months before the attack. Gadi Moses, 80 Gadi Moses was one of the oldest hostages who remained in captivity in Gaza. He was taken from his home on Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest-hit in the Hamas-led attack. The hostages forum described Moses as an expert agronomist who lectured on agriculture and helped maintain the kibbutz’s community vegetable garden. Moses’ partner, Efrat, was killed during the attack. Watchara Sriaoun, 33 In the Oct. 7 attack, militants overran the compound where agricultural workers lived on Kibbutz Nir Oz. Out of the 16 Thai workers living there, 11 were killed and five, including Watchara Sriaoun, were abducted. They were among at least 31 Thai workers taken in the assault. In the November 2023 ceasefire, 23 were released in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran. Sathian Suwannakham, 35 Sathian Suwannakham was also taken from Nir Oz. The kibbutz has continued to advocate for the release of the Thai workers by posting regularly about them on social media, in addition to the Israeli hostages. Surasak Rumnao, 32 Surasak Rumnao was abducted from the town of Yesha, located near the southern Gaza Strip. His mother, Khammee Lamnao, said the Thai Embassy in Israel called her to let her know her son would be released. Pongsak Thaenna, 36 Pongsak Thaenna was also taken from the town of Yesha. Thais make up the largest group of foreigners held in Gaza.

Bannawat Saethao, 27 Bannawat Saethao was also abducted from the town of Yesha. Liri Albag, 19 Liri Albag, who was among those abducted from the Nahal Oz military base, was featured in a video Hamas released in early January, filmed under duress. Her family said the video was “difficult to watch” because of Albag’s clear emotional distress. They were particularly active in the protest movement pushing for a deal with Hamas to bring the hostages home. “Liri, if you’re hearing us, tell the others that all the families are moving heaven and earth and want their children home, and we will fight until all hostages are returned,” her father said in a statement after the video was released. Karina Ariev, 20 Karina Ariev was also taken from Nahal Oz. Just before she was abducted, she she sent a message to her family, saying: “If I don’t live, take care of mom and dad all their lives. Don’t give up, live,” according to Israeli media. Her family said she loves to cook, sing, dance and write poetry. Daniella Gilboa, 20 Also taken from Nahal Oz, Daniella Gilboa was originally named Danielle. Her parents changed it after she was taken captive, in line with a Jewish tradition that is believed to bring God’s protection. Gilboa, from Petah Tikva, a suburb of Tel Aviv, played piano and studied music in high school. She dreams of being a singer, according to Israeli media. Naama Levy, 20 The footage from Naama Levy’s abduction, in which she is wearing gray sweatpants covered in blood, was shown around the world. Levy, among those taken from Nahal Oz, is a triathlete.

Romi Gonen, 24 Romi Gonen was taken from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. She spoke to her family for nearly five hours as militants marauded through the festival grounds. She told them that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would seek shelter in some bushes. Her father, Eitan Goren, said she survived in part by learning Arabic, as it was the only way to communicate with her captors. “I just enjoy being with her even in silence, touching, hugging, watching her,” he said, a week after her release. “I missed it so much.” Emily Damari, 28 Emily Damari is a British-Israeli citizen abducted from her apartment on Kibbutz Kfar Aza. She lived in a small apartment in a neighborhood for young adults, the closest part of the kibbutz to Gaza. Militants broke through the border fence of the kibbutz and ransacked the neighborhood. The day after her release, Emily’s mother, Mandy, said her daughter was “in high spirits and on the road to recovery.” Doron Steinbrecher, 31 Doron Steinbrecher is a veterinary nurse who loves animals, and a neighbor to Damari in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Steinbrecher holds both Israeli and Romanian citizenship. Steinbrecher was featured in a video released by Hamas in January 2024, along with two female Israeli soldiers. Her brother said the video gave them hope that she was alive but sparked concern because she looked tired, weak and gaunt. ___ Associated Press writer Haruka Nega in Bangkok, Thailand, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at"

        "content": "myMotherLode.com - The Mother Lode's Local News, Sports, Weather, Movies, Classifieds, Yellow Pages, Real Estate Who are the hostages freed by Hamas as part of the ceasefire in Gaza? JERUSALEM (AP) — The bodies of four Israelis taken captive by Hamas, including those said to be of the last female and child hostages in Gaza, were released Thursday, bringing to 28 the number of captives freed since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Jan. 19. The bodies returned to Israel are presumed to include Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose plight has captivated Israelis since they were taken during Hamas’ deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023. The body of one of the oldest hostages held was also said to have been returned. The remains now need to be formally identified. In the first phase of the ceasefire deal, a total of 33 hostages in Gaza — eight of whom are dead — are supposed to be freed in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Five Thai citizens who were working in Israel on the day of the attack were freed last month as part of a separate deal. Hamas-led militants took 251 hostages during their Oct. 7, 2023, attack that launched the war in Gaza. More than 60 hostages remain in Gaza, although about half are believed to be dead. The others were released, rescued, or their bodies recovered. Israel’s military campaign has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says more than half were women or children. Here’s a look at the hostages returned so far: Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas The bodies said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir Bibas, were returned Thursday. They were abducted along with Shiri’s husband, Yarden, from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas said the three were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Yarden Bibas was released earlier this month during the ceasefire deal. A video capturing their abduction showed a terrified Shiri Bibas swaddling her two redheaded sons in a blanket and being carried away by militants. The footage ricocheted around the world in the hours after the attack began. Ariel was 4 years old at the time of the attack and his brother, Kfir, was 9 months old, making him the youngest captive taken by Hamas. Ariel Bibas loved Batman and family photos showed the four Bibases dressed as the character. Kfir, the infant with red hair and a toothless smile, became a symbol across Israel for the feelings of helplessness and anger over the hostages’ captivity. Oded Lifshitz, 84 The body said to be of Oded Lifshitz, one of the oldest hostages held by the militants, was returned Thursday. He was taken captive from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded Lifshitz was shot in the hand in the attack. His family has suspected for months that he died in captivity. The couple are among the founders of Nir Oz. Oded, a journalist, campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews. In retirement, he drove to the Erez border crossing on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip once a week to ferry Palestinians to medical appointments in Israel as part of a group called On the Way to Recovery. Oded took pride in his work helping the traditionally nomadic Bedouin people of the Negev Desert, his daughter told The Associated Press, describing a case that went to Israel’s High Court and resulted in the return of some of their land. Sagui Dekel Chen, 36 An Israeli-American, Chen was working outside on his pet project, bus conversions, when militants stormed his kibbutz. He instructed his wife, Avital, to hide in the safe room with their two daughters. Chen, one of the first people to raise alarm of the infiltration on the kibbutz, was taken captive. Avital was seven months pregnant at the time of the attack; she gave birth to a third daughter, Shachar Mazal, in December 2023. Chen is an avid tennis player who co-founded an arts center for young people in southern Israel, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group representing the families of hostages, Iair Horn, 46 Horn is an Israel-Argentinian who was taken captive along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who was staying with him at the time. Eitan Horn remains in captivity and his name is not on the list of hostages to be released during the ceasefire’s first phase. Iair Horn managed the kibbutz pub and is a fan of the local soccer team in Beer Sheba, according to the hostages forum. Friends gathered at the kibbutz pub on Nir Oz to watch Horn’s release from captivity and to toast his return, according to Israeli media. Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29 Sasha Trufanov, an Israeli-Russian, was taken hostage along with three members of his family: grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and girlfriend Sapir Cohen. His father, Vitaly Trufanov, was killed on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest of his family was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Sasha Troufanov works as an engineer for Amazon, according to the hostages forum. His family immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union 25 years ago. He was believed to be held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza, which has released multiple videos of him in captivity, including one just hours before his release. Eli Sharabi, 52 Eli Sharabi was taken captive by the militants from Kibbutz Beeri, a communal farm that was one of the hardest hit in the Hamas attack. His British-born wife, Lianne, and their teenage daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were killed by militants while hiding in their safe room. His brother, Yossi Sharabi, who lived next door, was killed in captivity. Hamas militants are holding his body, according to the Hostages Forum. Eli Sharabi’s home bore marks from the attack months later. AP journalists saw bullet holes in the walls and the shattered oven and TV screens. Nearby homes were torched by militants and their roofs blasted off during fighting on Oct. 7. Ohad Ben Ami, 56 Ohad Ben Ami, a father to three, was taken captive with his wife, Raz, from Kibbutz Beeri, where he was an accountant. Raz Ben Ami was released during the weeklong ceasefire in November 2023.

        "content": "First-time MLA Rekha Gupta took oath as the Chief Minister of Delhi on Feb. 20, marking the beginning of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) return to power in the national capital after 27 years. Several prominent leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Swati Maliwal attended the grand ceremony, held at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan. BJP MLAs including Parvesh Verma, Ashish Sood and Manjinder Singh Sirsa also took oath as cabinet ministers during the swearing-in ceremony. With its return to power in Delhi, the BJP now directly governs 14 states and union territories in India. This number rises to 19 when including the chief ministers from its political alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In the last six months, the BJP cemented its position as the most popular political party by retaining several key states, including Maharashtra and Haryana, and making significant gains in regions like Jammu and Kashmir. Some of the most highlighted CMs of BJP are Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Himanta Biswa Sarma (Assam), Devendra Fadnavis (Maharashtra), and Pushkar Singh Dhami (Uttarakhand). Additionally, BJP CMs are also present in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Goa, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Two of the most prominent NDA CMs, Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh) and Nitish Kumar (Bihar) played a key role as kingmakers in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, helping the BJP retain power at the Centre for a third consecutive term. Other NDA-ruled states are Sikkim and Meghalaya. The BJP also governed Manipur, but the state was placed under the President’s Rule last week after N Biren Singh resigned from the CM’s post. The main opposition party Congress has CMs in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Telangana. Siddaramaiah returned as CM of Karnataka after Congress ousted the BJP government in the 2023 Assembly elections. Similarly, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu leads the Congress government in Himachal Pradesh, while Telangana saw a change of guard in December 2023, with the Revanth Reddy-led government replacing Chandrashekar Rao's Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS). With Delhi's loss in the Feb. 5 elections, the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP is now restricted to Punjab, where comedian-turned-politician Bhagwant Mann is the CM. Newly sworn-in Delhi CM Rekha Gupta will join West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee as one of the only two women CMs in India. Jharkhand Assembly elections 2024 saw Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha retain power. In Tamil Nadu, MK Stalin serves as the CM, leading the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leads Kerala. Here's a list of all the leaders who serve as chief ministers in India:"

        "content": "With President Donald Trump’s rearrival in the White House, China is skillfully exploiting Europe’s growing rift with the United States to seek out European leaders willing to step back from the protectionism they began to build during the Biden era to shield themselves against Chinese economic dominance. That the tone is changing both in Beijing and Europe was evident during the many discussions that China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, had during his latest tour to Europe earlier this month. Wang reminded EU foreign secretary Kaja Kallas that “There is no fundamental conflict of interest or geopolitical conflicts between China and the EU.” Thus the message is loud and clear: China is willing to sort out any outstanding issues, using both bilateral and multilateral channels. In turn, Kallas ensured the EU’s willingness to continue to “dialogue and cooperate” with China. Wang Yi’s outreach is both timely and a stark contrast to US Vice President JD Vance’s scathing remarks about European countries in the speech he delivered at the February 14-16 Munich security conference. Leading European papers described Vance’s remarks as “disturbing.” Vance ruled out that the EU was facing any external threats. “What I worry about is the threat from within,” Vance said. He criticized European leaders for being afraid of the voices of their own people, accusing them of imposing “digital censorship.” It was clearly understood that Vance was alluding to the far right, including the AfD in Germany, which traces its origins to Naziism. Vance blistered the EU for not treating the issue of migration as a security matter as the Trump administration is doing. Vance drew a clear line between the EU and the US insofar as the latter does not see the former ‘right’ enough. Vance later on met with the leader of the AfD, confirming the Trump administration’s preference for the far right. Vance declined to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz despite an invitation. But before Vance delivered his speech, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, had already said in his speech that “the new American administration holds a worldview that is very different from our own. One that shows no regard for established rules, for partnerships or for the trust that has been built over time.” Later, the German chancellor described Vance’s remarks as unacceptable. Enter China In the ongoing peace talks between Russia and the US over Ukraine, EU stands completely excluded, as is Ukraine itself. Not only is the EU not present on the table, but talks are taking place in Saudi Arabia, demonstrating both the geographical and political distances that are already there between the US and the EU. Wang Yi used his speech at the conference to hit where it hurt the most. Ordinarily, one would expect Chinese positions over Ukraine to align with Russia’s. But this was not the case. Wang instead backed EU’s position, saying, “we hope that all parties and stakeholders directly involved participate in the peace talks in due course.” As the war is taking place on European soil, he said, “it is all the more necessary for Europe to play its part for peace, to jointly address the root causes of the crisis, to find a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework, and to achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe.” Without necessarily risking its ties with Moscow, Beijing is pursuing a purely pragmatic approach informed by realpolitik. By proposing a role for the EU in the talks, Beijing is not necessarily complicating Russia’s positions, for a US decision to withdraw its military support for Ukraine would end the conflict in Russia’s favor whether EU likes it or not. But by taking a pro-EU position, China hopes to only further the transatlantic wedge being created by the Trump administration, ultimately hoping to wean the EU away from the US as much as possible and minimizing chances for a transatlantic alliance to emerge, let alone consolidate, against China. Wang, therefore, delivered a message of following an overall “pragmatic” approach. For Beijing, this pragmatism holds dual significance. First, there is little denying that China is the EU’s largest import partner. The message was delivered to the EU’s largest economy also because Germany had voted against EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EV) last year. (The German decision was also informed by a desire to avoid Chinese tariffs on German car exports to China.) Still, China’s message has implications for the entire EU, both in the context of the EU-US state of affairs and the EU’s increasing, logical focus on keeping its interests, including reviving its global position, up front. Last year, the 2024 Draghi report on European competitiveness, whose author is Italy’s former prime minister, made clear the critical changes EU needed to make to stay competitive. Wang made sure to convey China’s willingness to German, EU, and French leaders to deepen “all-round cooperation”. Second, by offering a pragmatic approach, China hopes to isolate the US position on geopolitical issues like Taiwan. On February 16, the US State Department quietly changed its factsheet on US-Taiwan relations, deleting its long-standing phrase that said the US does “not support Tawain independence.” Trump has already caused jitters in Taipei when he said last week that Taiwan, the world’s leading maker of semiconductors, had taken the chip business away from the US and that he wants it to come back, and declaring that Taiwan is rich enough to pay for its own defense. Multipolarity By seeking to wean the EU away from the US, China ultimately hopes for a more multipolar world order. “A multipolar world is not only a historical inevitability; it is also becoming a reality,” Wang said in his Munich speech. This is where both China and Russia find their interests converging and this is why Russia is unlikely to have any serious issues with China quietly supporting a place for the EU at the negotiating table. Ultimately, Russia sees the US-backed NATO as a threat. If the EU ultimately opts for a European security system, Russia stands to gain from it. More balanced ties between EU and Russia in the future can also revive Russian economic ties with the continent. In the long run, therefore, the plan is to remove the US from the European equation. The UK pushed itself out through Brexit. If the US is no longer there as a dominant player, it will only further the Chinese (and Russian) position globally, not just in Europe, to the US’s growing disadvantage.

        "content": "The Afghan brothers worked closely with the American military for years, fighting the Taliban alongside U.S. troops, including the Special Forces, and facing gunfire and near misses from roadside bombs while watching their friends die. They escaped Afghanistan in 2021 when the Taliban seized control of the country. One brother is now an elite U.S. Army paratrooper at Fort Liberty in North Carolina. The other serves in the Army Reserve in Houston. Their eldest sister and her husband, however, were stranded in Afghanistan, forced into hiding as they waited for the U.S. government to green-light their refugee applications. Finally, after three years, they received those approvals in December and, according to the family, were slated to reunite with their brothers this month. But weeks before the couple was due to arrive, President Donald Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending the admission of refugees. The order was the first in a series of sweeping actions that blocked the arrival of more than 10,000 refugees who already had flights booked for the U.S. and that froze funding for national and international resettlement organizations. A top former government official who worked on refugee issues told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune that another 100,000 refugees who had already been vetted by the Department of Homeland Security have also been blocked from entering the country. The official, who declined to be identified for fear of retribution, said the Trump administration is “moving so swiftly that there might not be much of a refugee program left to recover.” Taken together, Trump’s actions are effectively dismantling the U.S. refugee system and eroding the country’s historic commitment to legal immigration, according to refugee resettlement and U.S. military experts, who say the most egregious examples include denying entrance to thousands of Afghans who worked with the U.S. military and their relatives. The refugees “have been going through the process, which is very slow and very detailed and offers extreme scrutiny on each and every individual, and now, all of a sudden, that too is no longer acceptable,” said Erol Kekic, senior vice president with Church World Service, one of 10 national programs that work with the U.S. government to resettle refugees. “We’re basically abandoning humanity at this moment in time, and America has been known for being that shining star and guiding countries in the world when it comes to doing the right thing for people in need,” Kekic said. “Now we’re not.” The orders halting aid to international groups also indirectly affected a separate visa program for Afghan translators who worked with the U.S. military, closing off yet another avenue by which thousands hoped to enter the country. Together, the Trump administration’s actions have likely shuttered pathways to the U.S. for about 200,000 Afghans and their relatives whose refugee and military visa applications are currently being reviewed, including tens of thousands who have been vetted, the former U.S. government official said. Abandoning Afghan allies whose work with the U.S. has them facing threats of retribution and death imperils the country’s standing abroad and makes the military’s job exceedingly difficult, said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and onetime dean of Texas A&M University’s George Bush School of Government and Public Service. If the Trump administration does not quickly exempt Afghans from the refugee-related orders, “good luck signing up the next bunch of recruits to help us in our endeavors in the future,” said Crocker, who is now a fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a nonpartisan international think tank in Washington, D.C. “The entire world sees what we do and don’t do to support those who supported us,” Crocker said. Spokespeople for the White House, the U.S. State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not respond to requests for comment about the escalated actions by Trump, who slashed refugee admissions to a record low of 15,000 in the final year of his first term. Refugees and a coalition of resettlement groups filed the first refugee-related lawsuit against the administration last week, seeking to reverse the executive orders. It argues that the recent actions violate Congress’ authority to make immigration laws and that the administration did not follow federal regulations in implementing them. Another resettlement group, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also sued the Trump administration over its refugee actions this week, arguing that they were unlawful. The executive orders promise a review in 90 days and say that the State Department and DHS could grant exemptions “on a case-by-case basis,” but refugee groups said that neither agency has explained who is eligible or how to request such a waiver. The Afghan brothers, who asked to be identified by an abbreviation of their last name, Mojo, are hoping the answers come quickly. They are among at least 200 Afghan Americans currently serving in the U.S. military whose family members applied for refugee status, only to be suddenly denied entrance. “We feel betrayed,” the brother in Houston said. “We serve this country because it protected us, but now it is abandoning my sister, who is in danger because of our work with America.” The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which Congress created in 1980 following the Vietnam War, allows legal immigration for people fleeing their countries if they meet the narrow definition of being persecuted. To qualify, refugees must prove that they have been targeted for political, racial or religious reasons or because they are part of a threatened social or ethnic group. The vetting, which requires multiple security screenings and medical examinations, takes an average of about two years, according to experts. Those who had made it through the process and are now unable to come because of Trump’s recent actions include the children of a former U.S. military translator living in Massachusetts with his wife. The Afghan couple waited three years to reunite with their children, who were separated from their parents at the Kabul airport on the day of the Taliban takeover and have been living in Qatar during the yearslong vetting process. The kids, ages six to 17, were about to board their flights in Doha last month when the executive orders suddenly blocked their travel, leaving them in Qatar, where they had been supported by international refugee agencies that were funded, in part, by the U.S. government. It’s uncertain how much longer they can stay in Qatar, said their father, Gul, who asked that his last name not be published to protect his family. “When my wife heard this news, she fell on the ground and lost consciousness,” Gul said. “We have waited years for them to come and in a few hours, everything changed.” A former Texas National Guard member was beside himself when he talked about how his plans to be reunited with his wife later this month had been upended. She is a member of the Hazara minority group, which has historically been the target of widespread attacks and abuses including from the Islamic State’s affiliate in Afghanistan, according to a 2022 report by Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy group. His work for the U.S. military, he said, put her in even more danger. “I don’t know what we’re going to do,” he sobbed into the phone. The actions have also blocked the arrival of persecuted Christians, whom Trump had previously vowed to protect. That includes an Afghan family whose conversion led to violent attacks from conservative Muslims, according to refugee organizations. Word of their persecution spurred a church in the conservative East Texas community of Tyler to sponsor the family’s refugee resettlement applications. Justin Reese, a 42-year-old software developer in Tyler who volunteers to help resettle refugees, said telling the family that it could no longer come was heartbreaking. “You went from this level of commitment and certainty to none at all, literally in the space of a couple of minutes,” he said. Aside from halting arrivals, Trump’s orders have blocked funding to U.S. nonprofit resettlement organizations, which caused them to lay off or furlough hundreds of employees and hindered their ability to help refugees already in the country. In Houston, for example, the YMCA is currently restricted from offering about 400 new refugees basic services such as housing and health screening to help set them up for self-sufficiency, said Jeff Watkins, the organization’s chief international initiatives officer. The nonprofit is temporarily relying on private funds and other programs to ensure that refugees’ housing and food needs are met and that they are not stranded, but Watkins said that is not sustainable for the long term. “This becomes a community issue if those needs aren’t addressed,” Watkins said. The Afghan brothers in Houston and North Carolina said that their sister and her husband were forced to flee their home three years ago after the Taliban published photos of the brothers working with American troops and interrogated neighbors about their whereabouts. The couple, who are both physicians, could no longer work. They moved every few months, relying on wire transfers sent by the brothers as they waited for the U.S. government to approve their refugee applications. Now they are forced to continue hiding, but this time the path toward safety feels more nebulous. Each day with no action increases the danger for stranded Afghans like them, said Shawn VanDiver, a U.S. Navy veteran who leads AfghanEvac, an organization that he began to help those left behind after the withdrawal. “The Taliban is routinely harassing and torturing folks associated with us,” he said. For years, Republicans criticized Biden for his handling of the withdrawal. “Now is the time for them to stand with our Afghan allies and fix this,” VanDiver said. A Taliban spokesperson disputed in a text that it targeted those who worked with the U.S. military. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, however, in 2023 documented more than 200 killings of former officials and members of the armed forces after the takeover, but international human rights officials have said the true number is likely far higher. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, one of Biden’s critics on Afghanistan, said in a recent interview with CBS News that the U.S. needed to “live up to our word” to protect Afghan allies. “Otherwise, down the road, in another conflict, no one’s going to trust us,” he said. But McCaul avoided criticizing Trump in a statement to ProPublica and the Tribune, saying that he believed the president would listen to veterans who have called for an exemption for Afghan allies. The Houston brother said that he hopes that Trump will ultimately do the right thing for the families of servicemen like him and his brother, who have sacrificed so much for America. His brother in North Carolina has written to his congressman to request an exemption for Afghans who “have been doing everything legally, following the law.” “We don’t want to be worried about our loved ones being left behind in Afghanistan, and that will help boost our morale and our confidence in serving the American people with integrity,” he said. That service, according to the North Carolina brother, will soon include a deployment to the Texas border with Mexico, where his unit would be ordered to aid the curtailing of illegal immigration.

Stay Here By Laura May Todd When the Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi completed the soaring cupola of the Duomo in Florence, Italy, in 1436, it was a feat of engineering that reshaped the city’s skyline. (It’s still the largest brick dome in existence.) From the surrounding hills, its red-tinged peak appears to hover above a sea of terra-cotta rooftops. Guests of Collegio alla Querce, the first Auberge Resorts Collection hotel in Italy, will have that vantage point from a 16th-century former college perched on the cusp of the Tuscan countryside. Designed in collaboration with the Florence-based studio ArchFlorence, the interiors pay homage to both the building’s scholastic past and its idyllic rural surroundings. The hotel’s restaurant, La Gamella — a refined trattoria named after the tin lunchboxes once carried by Florentine schoolchildren — occupies the college’s former dining hall, which in the 16th century was an open-air citrus garden. For aperitivi and nightcaps, there’s Bar Bertelli, dedicated to a former science teacher whose instruments are still on-site. In some guest rooms and suites not already adorned with original frescoes, walls were painted with sweeping landscapes, their hazy greens and ecrus a nod to the bucolic murals of Pompeian villas. Kemper Hyers, the creative director for Auberge Resort Collections, commissioned custom furniture for the 83 rooms and suites from Milan’s Paolo Castelli along with earth-toned ceramics by Studio Ceramico Giusti, which he discovered at the weekly market in Piazza Santo Spirito, just a short walk down the hill. Collegio alla Querce opens March 2. From about $1,600 a night, aubergeresorts.com. See This By Kin Woo The performance artist Leigh Bowery packed a lot into his brief life before he died in 1994 from complications related to AIDS at age 33: he was a fashion designer, an art director for music videos, the frontman of a transgressive pop band called Minty and a model for the painter Lucian Freud. He resisted easy categorization, once remarking, “If you label me, you negate me.” Born in a sleepy suburb in Melbourne, Australia, Bowery moved to London in 1980 at 19 and proceeded to reinvent himself on the underground queer club circuit, particularly at Taboo, the renowned nightclub he founded. Using an array of bedazzled masks, bondage gear, wigs and sky-high platforms that further elevated his 6-foot-3 frame, he pushed the limits of transformation — and the norms of the time — through clothing and makeup. Thirty years after his death, his influence can be seen everywhere from the anarchic aesthetics of designers like Rick Owens and Charles Jeffrey to the subversive costumes worn by Lady Gaga. This month, a new retrospective opens at the Tate Modern in London. In a series of themed rooms — home, the club, the stage and the gallery — the show explores Bowery’s art, life and legacy through paintings, photographs, films and interviews with many of his collaborators, including the artist Cerith Wyn Evans, the drag queen Lady Bunny, the DJ Princess Julia and the musician Boy George. “Leigh Bowery!” will be on view at Tate Modern, London, from Feb. 27 through Aug. 31, tate.org.uk. Visit This By Gisela Williams Berlin’s Clärchens Ballhaus was built in 1913, at a time when the city had over 900 ballrooms. Now it’s one of the few left, and over the decades it has remained a beloved institution, hosting tango lessons every week in its landmark Hall of Mirrors. But it was underused and in disrepair, says the Berlin-born entrepreneur Yoram Roth: “The main ballroom only had one power outlet, and it was heated by two coal ovens.” In 2018, Roth — who also owns Fotografiska, a group of contemporary photography museums, and the NeueHouse co-working spaces in New York and L.A. — bought Clärchens and began planning a renovation. “Berliners never want anything to change,” he says. “I knew I had to completely redo the infrastructure but still make sure it looked like it did 112 years ago.” He kept the tango lessons (along with other types of dance instruction) and hired Uli Hanisch, the set designer for the neo-noir TV series “Babylon Berlin,” who carefully enhanced Clärchens’ faded ’20s aesthetic. Roth then brought on the German chef Tobias Beck to open the party-friendly restaurant Luna D’Oro, named after one of the Ballhaus’s dance teachers. “Tobias understands German cuisine but has a sense of humor about it,” says Roth, who recommends the Tartar Igel, a classic beef tartare in the shape of a hedgehog with spines made from thin slivers of onion. claerchensball.haus. Try This By Angela Koh One of the first beauty tips my mother shared with me was that I should wash my face with rice water, the milky liquid left behind after rinsing grains before cooking. She swore by its brightening and softening effects and, all these years later, I do too. Rice has long been revered in skin care, a tradition reflected in the luxury hotel group Aman’s Essential Skin range. The six-product collection incorporates ancient purple rice bran extract, celebrated for its antioxidant properties and collagen-boosting abilities, alongside indigo extract, a botanical once favored by samurai for its healing benefits. My go-to is the Illuminating Eye Cream, infused with rice ferment and peptides, which brightens and revitalizes the under-eye area. Damdam Tokyo, which was founded by Giselle Go and Philippe Terrien in 2019, showcases rice along with other Japanese ingredients such as shiso and konnyaku, a Japanese root crop used for detoxification. The company’s Silk Rice Cleansing Oil, which removes makeup and dirt, features Japanese komenuka, a glutinous rice with anti-inflammatory properties. The Tokyo-based beauty brand Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream, newly available in refillable jars, pairs Japanese purple rice with botanical extracts that attract moisture to plump and hydrate. The Korean beauty brand House of Dohwa’s signature ingredient is domestically harvested rice from the city of Icheon. The Seoul-based company makes a Rice Bran Sheet Mask that also contains Houttuynia cordata (a flowering plant) and Korean mugwort extract, both of which soothe the skin. Other K-Beauty products, which I’ve discovered on Soko Glam, an online retailer specializing in Korean skin care, are the I’m From Rice Toner, which helps eliminate dead skin, and COSRX’s Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask that’s meant to be used as the last step of your routine. Eat Here By Amy Conway There’s a new crop of restaurants in the Berkshires, the art-filled Massachusetts hill country that’s an easy weekend trip from both New York City and Boston. In a region where farm-to-table fare is expected, Cantina, which opened in October in New Marlborough, does one better. Its owner, Peter Chapin, also owns nearby Mill River Farm, and the team grow or raise much of what’s used in the globally inspired cuisine — down to the eggs for the fennel ice cream on the menu one recent night. The mood at No Comply, in Great Barrington, is casual and playful (it’s named for a skateboarding trick), but chef-owner Stephen Browning’s skills are serious. Its ever-changing menu is veg-forward, with dishes such as roasted Japanese sweet potato with labneh, chili crisp and tahini. The restaurant is alcohol-free, but the turmeric tonic, tamarind cooler and strawberry milk go down nicely. After buying the historic Apple Tree Inn in the nearby town of Lenox, Claire Collery partnered with the Israeli chef Hagai Avrahami and his wife, creative director Adi Talby, on the brunch restaurant Baladi, where shakshuka and other Mediterranean-influenced dishes are accompanied by a view of the surrounding hills. In South Egremont, you might find Hy’s Fried owner Jack Luber spinning vinyl after tables have been moved to make room for dancing. With the feel of a vintage roadside joint, Hy’s has red vinyl booths, creative cocktails and a tight menu revolving around fried chicken that’s meant to be tossed with a homemade honey sambal. Go Here By Kate Maxwell Highstay, the Paris-based company offering short-stay, fully serviced pieds à terre in dead-center locations like the First Arrondissement and the Marais, is heading to the beach this spring with its first two villas. On Ibiza’s craggy southwest coast, close to the whitewashed village of Es Cubells, Villa Infinity is a conversion of a traditional stone finca by Athens’s K-Studio, which designed the beach club Scorpios in Mykonos. Architectural details such as pivoting chestnut-wood doors and a spiral stone-and-oak staircase serve as decorative pieces in the villa, which sleeps 14. The primary bedroom has a roof terrace and an en suite bathroom with Mediterranean views from the free-standing tub. Outside are an infinity pool, a second kitchen and an outdoor gym with a plunge pool. All meals are cooked by a private chef, while Highstay’s concierge can organize everything from guided meditation and Pilates sessions to yacht charters. Highstay is also venturing into the French Riviera with the art-filled Villa Coachella, which comes with a cinema and its own private spa, complete with a hammam and hot tub. Rates from about $51,670 for a week’s stay at Villa Infinity; $72,330 for a week’s stay at Villa Coachella, highstay.com. From T’s Instagram Advertisement"

        "content": "Akila Quinio in London Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter. Lloyds Banking Group has set aside an additional £700mn to cover the fallout from a probe and related court ruling on the historic mis-selling of car finance. Lloyds announced the provision on Thursday alongside its fourth-quarter results, which showed statutory profits before tax of £824mn in the final quarter of the year, below market expectations of £1.2bn and down from £1.8bn the previous year. The bank’s return on tangible equity — a key measure of profitability — was 12.3 per cent for the full year, below its target of 13 per cent. Quarterly revenues rose on the previous year to £4.4bn, slightly above expectations of £4.3bn. It expects a return on tangible equity of about 13.5 per cent next year and has maintained its 2026 guidance. Shares in Lloyds rose 4 per cent in morning trading. Lloyds already booked a £450mn provision last year to cover potential car finance mis-selling costs, after the Financial Conduct Authority began a probe of “discretionary commission arrangements”, where car dealerships received bigger commissions for charging higher interest rates on car finance loans. The practice was banned by the FCA in 2021 and the current investigations and legal rulings relate to historical cases. Analysts have increased their estimates of car finance mis-selling costs after the Court of Appeal ruled in October that it was unlawful for banks to pay any commission to car dealers if customers had not given informed consent. “The decision by the Court of Appeal . . . seems to be at odds with 30 years of regulation, and that creates a problem in the minds of investors . . . not just for the financial services sector, but actually a broader investability question in the UK,” said Lloyds’ chief executive Charlie Nunn. Banks have been pushing the government to intervene when the Supreme Court hears an appeal in April. But a panel of judges on Monday rejected the Treasury’s request to do so. The car finance costs have been an unwelcome distraction as Lloyds enters the final stretch of a £4bn investment plan. It is aiming to modernise its operations and expand in markets such as wealth management that provide more predictable fee-based income and are less closely tied to interest rates. Chief financial officer William Chalmers said the uncertainties about cost were related to the Supreme Court ruling, the structure of any compensation scheme and customer responses. Lloyds said in its annual report that it continued “to receive complaints as well as claims . . . in respect of motor finance commissions”. The company has pushed through cost cuts, including through the introduction of branch-sharing for three of its brands: Bank of Scotland, Halifax and Lloyds. It has also said it will close two offices, in Liverpool and Dunfermline, and is reviewing hundreds of jobs. Nunn said on Thursday that Lloyds was unlikely to make “fundamental, transformational” acquisitions in the next two years and was focusing on organic growth instead. Lloyds’ net interest margin — the difference between the interest it charges on loans and the rate it pays on customer deposits — rose to 2.97 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from 2.95 per cent the previous quarter. The group said it remained “highly committed to shareholder distributions” despite the car finance provision, announcing plans for a 2.11 pence per share final dividend and an up to £1.7bn share buyback."

        "content": "Advertisement Supported by The Opinions By Thomas L. Friedman and Patrick Healy Produced by Jillian Weinberger President Trump appears ready to cut a deal that could end Russia’s war in Ukraine without ever consulting Ukraine. In this episode, the deputy Opinion editor Patrick Healy talks to the Opinion columnist Tom Friedman about Trump’s unpredictable approach to foreign policy. Below is a transcript of an episode of “The Opinions.” We recommend listening to it in its original form for the full effect. You can do so using the player above or on the NYT Audio app, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts. Patrick Healy: This is “The First 100 Days,” a weekly series examining President Trump’s use of power and his drive to change America. I wanted to talk to Tom Friedman this week because we seem to be on the cusp of a major international realignment. Secretary of State Marco Rubio just met his Russian counterpart to talk about ending the war in Ukraine without Ukraine there, and without the rest of Europe. This came right after Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave speeches in Europe that boiled down to: What are you guys good for? And then there’s Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin acting thick as thieves. Are the presidents of the United States and Russia playing a giant version of that old board game Risk, with the future of the West hanging in the balance? Tom, thanks for being here. Thomas L. Friedman: My pleasure, Patrick. Healy: OK, Tom, you’ve written about Trump, how he sees himself as a disruptive figure, as someone who thinks that his stock in trade is to be a great negotiator, a great deal maker. And yet, he’s a guy who doesn’t do his homework. And I find myself wondering what Trump is really up to with these moves. I mean, he can’t actually think that he can move all of these people out of Gaza. He can’t actually think he can wave a magic wand and end the Ukraine war. Is something bigger going on with him when he makes these radical ideas in the foreign policy space? Friedman: You know, what concerns me about Trump, Patrick, is that he’s got a real upside. The upside is that he is ready to shake up the game board. And the game board sometimes really does need to be shaken up. Why are we still talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Why are there still Palestinian refugees 75 years after the birth of Israel? Why is this Ukraine war just dragging on as a war of attrition? So I think there’s something actually quite healthy about going back to basics and asking those questions. But Trump, at the same time, is a chump. And it’s a combination of being ready to ask really radical questions and then, when it comes to the answers, just buying everything Putin says. Healy: Buying it all, Tom, exactly. And Bibi Netanyahu and Putin — all of it. That’s the thing, that when I said “thick as thieves,” I don’t understand how Trump sees these guys who are clearly acting in their own interests, not in America’s interests. And it makes me wonder, for a President of the United States, does he think about America’s interests or is it just Donald Trump’s interests, whatever those are in the moment? So, I want to run my theory by you and have you slice and dice it. Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Bibi Netanyahu: I think Trump looks at these figures as people who are the strongmen of the world. And then there are all these weak societies and weak people. He looks at something like Europe and he sees it as a collection of failed economies and open borders and weak national identities. And he basically sees the world as up for grabs, as available to be carved up by the strong people, and I find myself wondering, in two years, if we’ll have a situation where the U.S. takes Greenland, Putin has done what he’s wanted in Ukraine, Netanyahu has a free hand in Gaza, in the Middle East, Xi does what he wants in Taiwan. I’m just wondering if this flows from a big assumption that Donald Trump has about the world where, in this day and age, we’ve reached the point where societies are so weak that the strong must prevail and reorder the world. Friedman: I think that’s a fair description of how he looks at the world. He looks at the world really like it’s the retail section in a Trump Tower. You know: Hey, Mr. France, you’re not paying enough rent for your baguette shop. Everything is purely transactional in that sense. What is he missing? You described a dog-eat-dog world of survival of the fittest and the strongest. We had that world, actually, before World War II. How did that work out? We have had the most remarkable long run of global peace and prosperity, all relatively speaking, since World War II. And during this 75-year period of relative peace, absence of great power conflict, we’ve seen more people come out of poverty faster than anytime in the history of the world. We’ve enjoyed a remarkable degree of global stability. Yes, there have been wars in between, but they have not been world wars, the kinds of things that overturn everyone’s life. You’re going to miss that period when it’s gone. I want to say a few words about Europe in particular. I happen to believe that the European Union may be mankind’s greatest creation, a continent known from time immemorial for religious, tribal and sectarian wars. The last two of which — actually, the last three of which, if you count the Cold War — we had to come over and help quell and intervene. [Europe] builds the biggest center of free markets, free people, the rule of law and human rights. That is a remarkable thing. The E.U. is the other United States of the world. Healy: But Tom, I think Trump sees the E.U. and these countries as chumps in their own right. He sees that collection and those shared values and he wonders: OK, what can I get from them? How do I realize that? Friedman: Well, he sees them as a trading block that can exercise more leverage on the United States than he’d like. So he’d like to break them up and then negotiate with each one individually. But he has no clue about the cost of that. If the E.U. were to break up, the instability it would bring. The E.U. is our wingman in the world. Let’s take a conflict I know a lot about, the West Bank conflict. E.U. aid is what keeps the Palestinian Authority basically operating. If the Palestinian Authority collapsed, Israel would then actually have to run all the civil and administrative affairs of the West Bank. You find E.U. projects all over the world, not to mention the stabilizing effect on Europe. But of course Trump isn’t thinking in those terms at all. That’s what really concerns me. I was saying to you earlier, Patrick, that to me, the single most underestimated force in international relations is actually stupidity, that leaders are just doing stupid stuff. What Vladimir Putin did in Ukraine was just flat-out stupid. He thought he’d be in and out of Kyiv in a few weeks and install a new government. He got it completely wrong. He couldn’t have gotten it more wrong, and he got it wrong because he was uninformed, misinformed and just making a stupid bet. Healy: So how does that Tom Friedman theory of stupidity apply to Trump’s steps toward Putin right now in terms of what he’s doing with Ukraine — really elevating Putin, caring more about what the Russians want to do — in an endgame? How does that kind of theory apply here? How could it even backfire? Friedman: Well, let’s put Trump in his own world. He’s trying to buy a casino. He finds out that the guy who owns the casino he wants to buy has one foot in receivership and one foot out. He’s run out of cash. The bank doesn’t want to lend him any more money. And Trump comes in and says, “You know what? I’ll pay double your asking price.” So basically, what Putin wants is for Trump to come in and save him from the battlefield failures that he engendered. This is a colossal failure. He’s got 21 percent interest rates, his economy now — again, everything’s going up in price with inflation because he had to shift so much production capacity to the war. He didn’t have the people and capacity to take care of the housing, cars, eggs that people need. So prices are going up there. This guy is playing an incredibly weak hand. And Trump is basically saying: Let’s see. I’ve got four of a kind, but I think I’ll fold. Healy: Why? Why is Trump throwing him this lifeline, Tom? What is he up to here? Friedman: I think it operates on three different levels. One is ignorance. But also, if Vladimir Putin were an American party, he’d be a Proud Boy, a white Christian nationalist who’s super anti-immigration and super anti-diversity, anti-L.G.B.T. Because, again, Trump and Putin both think that the greatest danger to their countries internally is wokeness and immigration. So Putin’s a Proud Boy, he’d be a Trump voter, he’d have been there on Jan. 6. He feels a certain cultural affinity with him that he certainly doesn’t feel with Volodymyr Zelensky, an authentic sort of Democrat. So I think that’s going on at the cultural, political level. At the geoeconomic level, I think Trump’s Ukraine strategy is all about his midterm election. Trump thinks: If I can actually end this war and lift sanctions on Russia, Russian oil will swamp the global market, it’ll drive down the price of gasoline at the pump and I will win the midterms. Just Trump saying he talked to Putin for 90 minutes, drove the global benchmark crude oil price down at one point. So you can see where the market is going. They smell this. What is Trump doing with both the Russians and Putin? With Putin, he basically said: Well, as we know, NATO in Ukraine, and you’re going to be able to keep some of the territory. Who goes into a negotiation for a casino by saying I’m going to let you keep this part of the land that you need even though you’re going bankrupt and I’m going to hire all your staff? Healy: No, man, you’re slipping them cards left and right. Friedman: Exactly. So basically, in Trump’s own terms, this is not a way to negotiate with pre-emptive concessions. Also, to tell the leverage you have on your side, Zelensky and the European Union, “I got this, you guys stay home.” Healy: Tom, I really wonder if part of Trump and Vance’s worldview is actually that history doesn’t repeat itself. That if you have the right strongmen in power, that somehow you can take a country like Germany, and if you have the right populist leaders in place, you can keep a lid on the really dangerous neo-Nazi elements, as long as you have everyone in your thrall. It feels like a command and control approach, but you know, you’ve been covering international relations for more than 40 years. It feels like the story, doesn’t end well, if you just ignore history, if you just believe so much in yourself as a kind of a godlike leader who could control events, to your point, you end up in World War I. You end up in places that you really don’t want to be. Friedman: Well, there were three major leaders on the world stage who wanted to be president for life. Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Xi managed to make himself president for life. Putin managed to make himself president for life. We stopped Trump from doing it, thank God. And how did it work out for China? How did that Covid thing work out? In a low information system where no one wants to tell the top guy the truth? Eventually, he changed course, but at great pain for the Chinese people. Russia has a similar low information system. Very little bad news ever gets to the guy at the top. That’s the only way someone like him could have invaded Ukraine. Low information systems are always dangerous. They’re particularly dangerous in a world where we have rapid change. Look, if Trump’s tariffs and his simultaneous removal of subsidies for green vehicles, if he’s able to implement that, our car companies — particularly Ford and General Motors — could get crushed. This is not a small thing. It’s just math. I’ve kind of given up on politics when dealing with Trump because at least until the midterms, there are no levers to pull. The Senate is all in on him. The House is all in on him. The Supreme Court is all in on him. His media ecosystem’s all in on him. I’m now entirely betting on physics, on the hard realities of things. You cannot move 2.2 million Palestinians from Gaza physically. And you are not going to get Ukraine to just surrender to Russia because you bat your eyes at them. There is the hard physics of things, and one of the physics is that our auto industry cannot survive in a world where the steel components it needs get tariffed by 25 percent and you basically crush the EV incentives. The physics of that, the math is not going to add up, and all you have to do is look at the Ford stock price to see it. They say the market is a voting machine and then it’s a weighing machine. And when you weigh the weight of these things, they don’t add up. If this weren’t my country, Pat, I’d put my feet up, grab some pop popcorn and watch the show. What a show! But it is my country. Trump is driving, we’re all in the back seat, and I think he’s heading into a wall. A Healy: Tom, transactions seem so central to Trump’s theory of power. He governs, in some ways, according to a balance sheet, and soft power is hard to quantify. So U.S.A.I.D. is off the table. He’ll get what he wants through a transaction or he’ll take it. What does that mean for world leaders looking to, I can’t believe I’m using this word, manage their relationships with Trump? Friedman: Let me answer that in two parts, Patrick. First, why does he have that ability to do that? Because of the complete collapse of the Republican members of the Senate and House to do their oversight job. Healy: Capitulation, Tom. Capitulation. Friedman: I look at these people and I say to myself: You people clearly do not have mirrors, wives or kids. Because if I did what you did, such craven sycophancy, I wouldn’t be able to look in the mirror. And if I did what you did, I would come home and my mattress and my golf clubs would be in the driveway. My wife would have thrown them out of the house and golf balls would be spinning down the driveway. My two daughters would not be talking to me. I look at these Republicans and say: You people clearly don’t have mirrors, wives and daughters. How does it work? Are you living on some offshore island? You’re doing all of this for $185,000 a year and free parking at [Ronald Reagan Washington] National Airport? What the [expletive] is wrong with you,? Beacuse the thing is, Pat, I actually don’t know anyone in my life who is that craven. Healy: So if the tight circle isn’t standing up — like if you’re the president of France or the chancellor of Germany and world leaders come looking at this guy who’s so transactional, is it kind of deal or no deal? Can you just stay to the sidelines and hope he doesn’t really send in the troops to Panama, or go for Greenland? Is there a way of managing Trump? Friedman: It’s a very good question. And right now everybody’s afraid. There’s so many C.E.O.s in America, and they know this tariff stuff is just crazy. But he was surrounded by buffers in his first term, and now he’s surrounded by amplifiers. He’s surrounded by bobbleheads, and that’s just really crazy. I think Xi and Putin probably get more pushback than Trump does now. Between the bobbleheads around him and then the echo chamber around them. And they’re all living in fear that Trump or Elon Musk, wait for it now, Pat, might tweet about them! Oh my God, did Elon give you an owie? And if they’re going to challenge you in the primaries, I promise you there are other jobs in the world than being in the U.S. Congress. And again, I say this as someone who is ready to see Trump disrupt things. I supported him on the Abraham Accords without flinching. When he does the right thing, I want to support my country. I don’t want to be in the position we’re all being put in where we have to root for our country to fail so our political position can be redeemed. That’s a terrible position to be in. I don’t want to root for the stock market to go down 5,000 points just so a dose of reality is imposed on this guy, but that’s the kind of position we’re in when people don’t do their jobs. The simple job of being in the House and the Senate is advise and consent. So the first time around he broke the laws, and this time around he’s destroying the norms, and when we get done, there will be nothing left. Healy: I just wonder, those world leaders who talk to you, do they see a future of Trump and Putin and Xi that really is kind of out of their control? Friedman: Well, right now they’re afraid. They’re afraid of Musk. I mean, this guy’s the wealthiest man in the world and he has the Twitter [now X] platform. But it’s why I keep coming back to physics. You may take Greenland, in which case Xi will take Taiwan. Then we’ll really be off to the races in the world. You think you just take Greenland and it doesn’t have an effect on others? Maybe Putin will then take a bite out of the Baltic States. Is that the world you want to be in? Let me know how that works. Healy: Tom, I really wonder if that is the world Trump would be OK with. Friedman: When the politicians responsible for being buffers don’t do their jobs, all I got is Newton and the third law of motion: For every action, there will be an equal and opposite reaction. That’s all I got left. I’ve pretty much given up on politics, but I do believe in the laws of gravity. The apple actually did fall from the tree. It didn’t jump from the ground into the tree. And eventually, the laws of gravity will make themselves felt. Unfortunately, we are in the back seat and he’s driving. Healy: Trump thinks he can pluck all the apples, but at some point, you know, one’s going to fall on his head. That’s the way it works. Friedman: It’s all I can hope for, because I clearly don’t have politics anymore. But I got The New York Times, and, um, thank God for that. Healy: Tom, thanks so much for joining me.

        "content": "Home » Down South Mohanlal’s Pulimurugan, released in 2016, was the first Malayalam film to enter the INR 100 crore club. Over time, it has been regarded as a classic, with widespread belief that the film was a massive financial success. With a reported gross of INR 140 crores, there are no doubts about its profitability. However, former DGP Tomin J. Thachankary had a different perspective on the film’s financial outcome. As the Managing Director of the Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC), a state-owned institution focused on business financing, he offered a contrasting view. Despite Pulimurugan’s box office performance, he suggested that financial matters related to the film’s production remained unresolved. According to Thachankary, the reality of the film’s financial situation was not as promising as the makers claimed. While the numbers indicated commercial success, the underlying financial structure and unresolved issues painted a different picture. His statement raised questions about the actual profitability of Pulimurugan, challenging the common perception of its success. Producer Tomichan Mulakupadam responded to the claim via Facebook, acknowledging that Pulimurugan faced budget overrun issues. He confirmed that he had taken a loan of INR 2 crores from the Kerala Financial Corporation’s Kottayam branch but clarified that the film was successful, allowing him to repay the full amount by December 2016. He further stated that he had to pay over INR 3 crores in income tax due to the film’s success, which, according to him, was proof of its financial achievement. Additionally, he highlighted that Pulimurugan had crossed the INR 100 crore mark within three weeks, even before its international release.

        "content": "Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by New data shows a rapid increase in recent years, driven by the young. The Trump administration has recently been rolling back L.G.B.T.Q. initiatives. By Claire Cain Miller and Francesca Paris Nearly one in 10 adults in the United States identifies as L.G.B.T.Q., according to a large analysis from Gallup released Thursday — almost triple the share since Gallup began counting in 2012, and up by two-thirds since 2020. Source: Gallup The increases have been driven by young people, and by bisexual women. Nearly one-quarter of adults in Generation Z, defined by Gallup as those 18 to 27, identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to the analysis, which included 14,000 adults across all of Gallup’s telephone surveys last year. More than half of these L.G.B.T.Q. young adults identify as bisexual. Among all respondents, 1.3 percent identified as transgender, up from 0.6 percent in 2020. That is higher than other large surveys have found in recent years. Respondents can choose multiple identities. Excludes categories with less than 0.1 percent of respondents. Source: Gallup Members of Gen Z were most likely to be transgender, Gallup found — 4.1 percent were, compared with 1.7 percent of millennials and less than 1 percent in each older generation. Various groups have tried to count this population, and Gallup’s survey is considered one of the most complete. Respondents were asked if they considered themselves straight or heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, and could choose more than one identity or volunteer another. About 86 percent of respondents said they were straight, according to Gallup. President Trump’s administration has recently reversed a variety of initiatives aimed at supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people, particularly those who are transgender. Based on an executive order declaring that there are only two sexes and that they cannot be changed, the Trump administration has threatened to end federal funding for hospitals that provide gender-transition health care to people under 19; ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams; and ban transgender people from serving in the military. The president has announced plans to revoke federal funding from schools that teach about “gender ideology,” and dismantled a policy protecting transgender students from discrimination. Government agencies have removed resources related to terms like L.G.B.T.Q. and gender from their websites. (Some have been restored under a court order.) Increasing L.G.B.T.Q. identification has been “largely driven by the many decades of gradual increasing societal acceptance,” said Dr. Mitchell R. Lunn, who co-directs the Pride Study, a research project at Stanford on the health of L.G.B.T.Q. people. Now, he said, “I think we may lose a lot of the really positive momentum that we’ve built over the past decades.” Dr. Lunn said he thinks the Gallup numbers are probably an underestimate, mostly because people might not feel comfortable sharing the information in a telephone survey. (Five percent of respondents declined to answer Gallup’s question.) He said he wouldn’t be surprised if the numbers declined next year, if social acceptance decreases under the Trump administration: “I worry that it will push some people to go back into the closet and not be out about their identity anymore.” In the surveys, there were large differences in L.G.B.T.Q. identification by political ideology. Twenty-one percent of liberals identified this way, compared with 3 percent of conservatives. There were also significant gender differences: Women were almost twice as likely as men to identify as L.G.B.T.Q. In Gen Z, 31 percent did, compared with 12 percent of men. Figures are rounded Source: Gallup Though L.G.B.T.Q. identification has increased in recent years for all but the oldest generations, it has grown fastest among young people. An average of 23 percent of Gen Z adults have identified this way over the last two years, up from 19 percent from 2020 to 2022. Most of them identify as bisexual. Of Gen Z women, 23 percent are bisexual, compared with 12 percent of millennial women. While men have generally been less likely to identify as bisexual, that is changing for those in their teens and 20s. Eight percent of Gen Z men identify as bisexual, compared with 2 percent of millennial men, and Gen Z is the only age group in which men are likelier to say they’re bisexual than gay. Bisexual men have faced additional stigma, studies have found, but researchers have said that might be changing for young men as the definition of masculinity has broadened, and as young people increasingly think about sexuality on a spectrum. Jessie Ford, a sociologist at Columbia, said that in her interviews with young people, they talk about wanting to be open in their sexuality and avoid rigid identities like straight or gay. Respondents can choose multiple identities Source: Gallup Young people have come of age during a period of unusually rapid social change in this area since the 2010s. It’s been driven by the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015, and by pop culture and social media. It’s now common for middle and high schools to have L.G.B.T.Q. affinity groups, which researchers have said are important for adolescent mental health at a time when they are exploring their identity. Schools have been especially welcoming in the West and Northeast, according to GLSEN, a nonprofit that researches L.G.B.T.Q. students. Yet even as acceptance has been growing, so has stigma. Many states, particularly ones led by Republicans, have proposed or enacted restrictions aimed at L.G.B.T.Q. young people in recent years, particularly young transgender people. This has probably contributed to the poor mental health of young people who are gay or transgender, researchers said. Claire Cain Miller is a Times reporter covering gender, families and education.

        "content": "Indian benchmark indices ended in the red on Thursday as concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25 per cent tariff threat on Indian goods triggered cautious sentiment. The BSE Sensex fell 203 points, or 0.27 per cent, to close at 75,736, while the NSE Nifty 50 dipped 20 points, or 0.19 per cent, to settle at 22,913.75. Banking and financial stocks bore the brunt, with Nifty Bank dropping 0.56 per cent to 49,292.55, while Nifty Financial Services declined 0.75 per cent to 23,281.40. However, PSU banks bucked the trend, trading in the green. Despite weakness in frontline indices, broader markets outperformed, with the Nifty Midcap 100 jumping 1.28 per cent to 51,175.15. Volatility eased, as India VIX cooled 4.57 per cent to 14.72. On the Nifty 50, HDFC Bank (-2.39%), Maruti Suzuki (-2.10%), Tech Mahindra (-1.71%), Tata Consumer (-1.59%), and HCL Tech (-1.25%) were the biggest losers. Meanwhile, Shriram Finance, NTPC, M&M, BEL, and Adani Ports & SEZ topped the gainers' list. “Concerns over fresh U.S. tariffs on Indian goods led to capital outflows, while fears of inflationary pressure weighed on sentiment. The latest Fed Minutes also suggest a potential delay in rate cuts,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, at Geojit Financial Services. Auto, metal, oil & gas, power, realty, and PSU banks gained between 1-2 per cent, while the bank index slipped 0.5 per cent, dragging down the benchmarks. Despite weakness in blue-chip stocks, strong momentum in mid and small caps kept investor sentiment buoyant.

AAP MLA Atishi also expressed her support, saying, \"It is a matter of happiness that Delhi will be led by a woman. I hope that the promises made to the people of Delhi will be fulfilled. You will get the full support of Aam Aadmi Party for the development of Delhi.\" Gupta, a first-time MLA from Shalimar Bagh, was elected as the leader of the BJP legislature party under the supervision of central observers—former Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and BJP national secretary Om Prakash Dhankhar. She now joins the ranks of Sushma Swaraj (BJP), Sheila Dikshit (Congress), and Atishi (AAP) as Delhi’s fourth woman chief minister.

        "content": "What to Watch Advertisement Supported by Critic’s Notebook Anthony Mackie picks up the shield at a potentially awkward time. But there’s one way Disney can do right by him and the next generation of Marvel stars. By Maya Phillips “Captain America: Brave New World” is a mediocre-at-best movie, a roughly cobbled together film that pales in comparison to the early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s still better than the franchise's most recent run of disasters, and its strong opening weekend at the box office seems to have restored some momentum to the M.C.U. But the most remarkable part of this film is the irony of how it lands in the political moment: “Brave New World” features a Black iteration of the quintessential American superhero a month into an administration that has made eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion one of its first priorities. In a way, Disney’s timing regarding diversity was always going to be off. For most of the run of one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, diversity was an afterthought. For the first decade of the M.C.U., over the course of more than a dozen films, the heroes carrying the franchise — the central protagonists — were exclusively white men, until Chadwick Boseman led “Black Panther” in 2018. So, yeah, Disney started out a little behind. But when it came down to the handoff of the star-spangled shield from the blond-haired and blue-eyed Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans) to Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Disney actually built a steady platform for the M.C.U.’s first Black Captain America to lead his own film. The 2021 Marvel TV series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” provided the space for Sam to develop into Captain America in earnest, not just as a kind of M.C.U. diversity hire. Sam’s transformation into the Captain could have easily been the M.C.U.’s version of “The Blind Side,” a tale of a Black man’s triumph under the tutelage of the true, original white hero. He also could have been the Uncle Tom Captain, a servile Black man unquestioningly putting his life on the line. But “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” explored Sam’s reticence in taking on the mantle of Captain America, given how his Blackness so often marginalized him, made him a target or turned him into a stereotype in the eyes of some of his fellow citizens. The show also introduced a Black super soldier named Isaiah Bradley, who received the super serum like Steve Rogers. But Isaiah never became the lauded hero Steve did; he was made a prisoner and a science project, jailed and experimented on for 30 years. He’s a reminder to Sam of what can happen as a Black man in American, no matter his standing, his strength or his title. This history and these racial issues don’t magically disappear when Sam gets his own film. Isaiah reappears in “Brave New World” to reinforce this point; he expresses his distrust of the government and warns Sam not to become a puppet for the president to use for his whims. In the movie, Isaiah is framed for an attack on the president, and a throng of police officers chase him across White House grounds and eventually imprison him. Isaiah is slated for execution. Yet again he serves as a reminder that even a Black superhero’s experience is still a Black man’s experience. By the end of “Brave New World,” Sam has, of course, saved Isaiah, among many others, and proved his mettle in some flashy choreographed fight scenes (with and without his new-and-improved flight suit from the Wakandans). The film plays up his Captain as its own distinct hero, a Captain America with no super serum but better gear, a different temperament and a different style of fighting. (Some of the Captain’s signature flourishes, like the impressive shield-wielding, remain.) Along with Shuri’s transformation into the Black Panther in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” Sam Wilson’s Captain America marks the official start of the next generation of Avengers, a lineup that will include more women and people of color. It should be the time for such a diverse lineup of heroes, a Black Captain America included. In fact, it should have been the time decades ago. And yet the ultimate irony of Disney’s limited and delayed attempts at representation are that this film (originally slated for a May 2024 release) now lands at a time not only when the president is striking down diversity initiatives, but when many corporations are following suit. Disney is one that is following the trend, having just publicly rolled back some of its D.E.I. efforts. Mackie’s Captain America has been met with predictable backlash from fans who think he isn’t worthy of the role. Though one weekend of receipts isn’t conclusive, it’s been apparent for the last several years that Marvel fans are ready for something new. And the best way for Disney to successfully usher fans through this next iteration is not by trying to predict which way the political winds will blow, but by providing well-written, fully developed characters of all backgrounds, with all the nuances and burdens and histories that come with them. This shouldn’t be too difficult or political an ask; Disney has shown itself capable, just not always willing. Maya Phillips is an arts and culture critic for The Times.

The Democratic Action Party (DAP) lawmaker said this is contrary to GPS questioning the validity of the Act in recent years. “Such sudden shift in position on the PDA 1974 is not only a glaring reversal but also a blatant betrayal of Sarawak’s oil and gas rights. “After years of questioning the validity of the PDA 1974, GPS is now fully recognising the very law that has been used to take control of Sarawak’s resources. “This is nothing short of selling off Sarawak’s oil and gas rights for the second time,” she said in a statement today. Yong pointed out that the recent statement from the Sarawak Premier’s Office clearly indicates that the GPS government has abandoned its previous claims and is now fully recognising the PDA 1974. She said past statements about safeguarding Sarawak’s oil and gas rights were nothing more than empty rhetoric aimed at winning votes. She stressed that Sarawakians deserve an explanation for this drastic U-turn. “If not for the efforts of DAP Sarawak chairman Chong Chieng Jen in raising this issue in Parliament, Sarawakians would still be kept in the dark about this critical decision that sold off our oil and gas rights for another round and Sarawak GPS’ underhanded tactics,” she said."

Altadena, Calif., has been a haven for Black artists for decades. Betye Saar, in patterned dress, and Charles White, in sunglasses, at Art in the Afternoon, an exhibition at the home of Jeffalyn and Alvin Johnson, June 1962. Credit...via Betye Saar and Roberts Projects Supported by By Sam Lubell Reporting from Los Angeles Before the Eaton fire raced across Altadena, destroying more than 9,000 of its buildings, many, even in nearby Los Angeles, barely knew of the place’s existence. This sleepy 42,000-person hamlet hugging the glowing foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains is not part of that city but an unincorporated community of Los Angeles County, and just far enough off the beaten track to blissfully avoid notice. Once typified by its bucolic quirkiness, tight-knit neighborhoods and generations-old churches and businesses, Altadena now consists of row after row of twisted, charred building remains, scorched car chassis, blinking or broken stoplights and the occasional khaki National Guard Humvee. The future, for now, is filled with toxic cleanup, insurance adjustments and conflicting visions for rebuilding. Yet the past has gained newfound prominence. With so much gone, Altadena’s histories are being unearthed, by residents, scholars and preservationists who say they may hold a key to making this a special place once again, and provide anchors for those weighing whether to stay. One of the most profound of Altadena’s legacies — its spectacular story of Black creative culture — had been buried not only under its seclusion, but also under layers of racial and institutional apathy, the loose accounting of informal memory, and the absence of formal plaques and other preservation markers. The fire has spurred calls for a more rigorous approach to remembrance. “Sometimes it takes a tragedy for people to mark history,” said Brandon Lamar, president of the N.A.A.C.P.’s Pasadena branch, whose own home was destroyed, as was his school, his grandparents’ home and their church. But that destruction, he noted, “does not mean that we can’t create public memories in spaces now, so that people can remember this information for generations to come.” Starting in the 1950s and ’60s, the west side of Altadena (and parts of neighboring northwest Pasadena not bulldozed for the 210 and 134 Freeways) drew middle-class Black families eager to buy homes. Many came because the redlining — discriminatory lending by banks — was less severe here, and some of the schools had been integrated comparatively early. The area became a magnet not just for Black teachers and social workers but also for Black artists from around the country, drawn to its affordability, inventive vibe, gorgeous mountain backdrop and general spirit of permissiveness. “It had this energy of bohemian California,” said Solomon Salim Moore, assistant curator of collections at the Benton Museum of Art at Pomona College. “You could have a little less scrutiny and a little more room to do your projects.” On Feb. 22, as part the Frieze Los Angeles art fair, a discussion called “Land Memories” will feature artists’ recollections of this unique legacy. The talk will be co-hosted by the Black Trustee Alliance for Art Museums, which will also share oral histories recorded from Altadena artists and residents, and collect new histories. Moore, who is also an artist, grew up in Altadena and said that its nonconformist spirit has endured to the present, even as prices have climbed and the Black population has fallen, according to the U.C.L.A. Bunche Center for African American Studies, to about 18 percent from 43 percent in 1980. Artists here, he said, loved that they could set up informal studios or even family compounds, or that they could enjoy little freedoms like hosting parties without friends worrying about permit parking. “Sometimes creative people need to step away because you need to get out of the light to see,” said Ian White, an artist, teacher and the son of Charles White, the renowned painter and printmaker whose haunting depictions of African Americans, their struggles and dignity, inspired generations of artists. He spent the last 20 years of his life in Altadena and is buried at the community’s Mountain View Cemetery. Ian lives in a house next to his father’s modest home (which he also owns) in the Meadows, a district along Altadena’s west edge that in the 1950s and ’60s became one of the first here to integrate. Virtually all of the Meadows survived the fire. Also living west of Lake Avenue (then the unofficial dividing line between white Altadena and Black Altadena) was John Outterbridge, the noted assemblage artist and longtime director of the Watts Towers Arts Center. His home on Fair Oaks Avenue was destroyed, along with much of his archive and family memorabilia, according to his daughter, Tami. The famed enamel artist Curtis Tann lived within walking distance, while the prolific sculptor Nathaniel Bustion, known as Sonny, lived near White in the Meadows. Betye Saar, 98, known for repurposing everyday objects into mystical collages, grew up in a home on northwest Pasadena’s Pepper Street, just blocks from Altadena’s west side. Sidney Poitier, a good friend of White’s from New York (White designed the poster art for Poitier’s film “The Defiant Ones”) and the first Black actor to win an Academy Award, rented a home in west Altadena before moving to Beverly Hills. Ivan Dixon, the actor and trailblazing director (White once played his stunt double), lived on Marengo Avenue, and the science fiction writer Octavia Butler on Morada Place. Later generations of Black artists continued to thrive here, including Mark Steven Greenfield, Yvonne Cole Meo, Senga Nengudi and Michael Chukes, and dozens of others holding down day jobs and creating whenever they could in this secret Eden. Charles White, already an established figure when he moved from New York in 1959 for health reasons — he had respiratory problems and was advised to live in a milder climate — would become the glue holding this arts community together. His home and studio, still standing, was a gathering place, with many artists competing for the honor of driving White to or from one place or another. (He didn’t drive.) Ian still refers to Saar, Outterbridge, Dixon, Poitier and Charles’s good friend Harry Belafonte as his “fictive aunts and uncles.” He recalled how his father set up the sculptor Richmond Barthé, a cornerstone of the Harlem Renaissance, with an apartment, and how his mother, a social worker named Frances Barrett, was his caregiver until the end (she was white and their marriage was further evidence of west Altadena’s status as a relative racial haven). “For White, it was about creating community and connections,” said Lauren Cross, the associate curator of American decorative arts at the Huntington art museum in Pasadena, where the exhibition “Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight” is on view through most of 2027. “He operated on a paradigm that ‘I’ve been given this opportunity, so I’m going to plug in artists I know who need it.’” White’s circle worked as a kind of family, lifting its members up. And White nurtured an equally significant cohort while teaching at Otis College of Art, helping spawn some of the art world’s greatest young talents, like Kerry James Marshall, David Hammons and Judithe Hernández. Many applied to Otis just to work with “Charlie,” as he was affectionately known. Saar, whom White would eventually recruit to teach at Otis, grew up in Altadena in the 1930s and ’40s. Her neighborhood’s paperboy, she told me, was Jackie Robinson, who lived down the street. Her local landmarks included the five-and-dime store, where she bought trinkets and art supplies. Though she would eventually settle in Laurel Canyon after studying art at Pasadena Junior College and U.C.LA., she has maintained tight family and professional relationships to both Altadena and northwest Pasadena throughout her life. In the 1950s Saar (whose maiden name was Brown) started a jewelry business, cleverly named Brown and Tann, with Curtis Tann. Saar’s sister, the teacher and civic leader Jeffalyn Johnson, settled in a home on Lincoln Avenue, where she and her husband, Alvin, hosted art shows in their backyard. Visitors would dress in their Sunday best. Other venues for art display, Saar said, were churches, afternoon tea parties and artist-run studios. Often there would be musical performances or book readings. “It was very Altadena — laid-back, informal and filled with makers supporting each other,” said Moore, adding that artists here often stayed under the radar, without recognition by distant galleries, museums and critics. When Saar and others broke through , they were often identified as part of the larger Los Angeles scene. And then came the fires. Hundreds of artists have lost their homes and studios, and it’s unclear how many will be able, or willing, to return. “I just don’t want to go through this again,” said La Monte Westmoreland, 83, a longtime Altadena collage artist who lost one home in the 1993 Kinneloa fire. He rebuilt, only to lose his patio, koi pond and metal and ceramic sculptures in this one. “I don’t want to think about the next fire.” The artist Kenturah Davis lost her home on Wistaria Place, as did her parents, both artists, less than a mile away. Davis worries about those without the means, or time, to rebuild, or the pressure to sell, from predatory forces already circling. But she is resolute. “I am going to build,” she said. “My parents feel the same way. It’s just a matter of how.” A substantial Black arts legacy has been badly damaged by the fires. The residences of many important artists have been lost, including those of the jazz saxophonist Benny Maupin, 84, and the jazz trumpeter Bobby Bradford, 90, whose collections of musical instruments were also destroyed. Critical public places where many of the city’s artists gathered, like the Altadena Baptist Church, the Little Red Hen — a Black-owned restaurant since 1972 — and Altadena Hardware, are gone. Ian White also pointed out that hundreds of Black artworks that used to grace the walls of lost houses were destroyed, too. “You walked into homes and they were cultural identifiers that spoke,” he said. Kellie Jones, a professor at Columbia University and the author of “South of Pico: African American Artists in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s,” said that art was often a kind of currency in the close community. “People would trade their art for a trip to the doctor’s office,” she said. Then there were the everyday works of creativity lost: mosaic steps, artworks hanging from trees, colorful gardens — “all these quirky things happening,” White said. This staggering loss of heritage has served as a grim reminder to the community to protect and cherish what’s left. “We’re grappling with what this place has been, what it is now, and what it wants to be,” Kenturah Davis said. Few of Altadena’s surviving Black heritage sites have been recognized officially, though that may change. Some people are lobbying to formally mark them in the public’s mind to protect them from future development. Charles White Park, a grassy expanse at Lincoln and Fair Oaks, is the rare public park in the United States named for a Black artist. The park survived, but it’s now surrounded by a sea of ruined houses. Ian White has been commissioned by the county to create new art pieces for the park, with details still being finalized, he said. Other local landmarks include Barthé Drive, a tiny street in northwest Pasadena that memorializes Richmond Barthé; and the gravesite of the abolitionist Owen Brown, son of John Brown, which Ian White rediscovered in 2012 up a winding trail in the Angeles National Forest, not far from his own house. In 2020 Los Angeles County conducted the Altadena African American Historic Resources Survey, which suggested that a handful of Black sites be designated as county landmarks. But none of the surviving sites — not the Meadows or a Black section of southwest Altadena that practiced self-policing in the 1970s to minimize local crime and abuse from local law enforcement — have been designated. “It’s literally because of resource constraints,” said Amy Bodek, director of Los Angeles County Planning. “We have been trying to landmark as many things as we can. But we have a very small preservation staff.” Bodek said she hopes the county will move to designate these areas, and revisit the survey to find more landmarks, which could include artists’ homes or informal markers like Victor Ving and Lisa Beggs’s 2022 “Welcome to Altadena” mural, which contains images of Charles White and Octavia Butler, and survived the fire. Steven Lewis is one of the leaders of the Altadena Rebuild Coalition, part of a group discussing rebuilding. “If these places weren’t iconic,” he noted, “they can be now, as places where people gather. To remember with each other everything that used to be around them.” The coalition is collecting oral histories from Altadenans. Some artists are finding creative release in commemorating the tragedy. Davis’s father, a painter known as Keni Arts, has created “Beauty From Ashes,” a series of plein-air watercolors documenting the ruins of neighborhood mainstays like Rhythms of the Village gift shop and Jim’s Burgers. He hopes they’ll be displayed at a local site, to recapture historical memory. The architect Matthew Milton lost his home and his parents’ home. They were examples of Jane’s Cottages, among a few hundred storybook residences with swooping rooflines and concave ceilings created by the builder Elisha P. Jane in the early 20th century. They became popular with the Black community; a party to celebrate the homes’ 100th birthday was set for Jan. 8, the day the Eaton fire did most of its damage. Milton is already drafting plans for a new compound that he said will draw on local history and create something modern and durable. Saar moved away from Altadena and eventually ended up in Laurel Canyon, after a devastating 1959 fire that destroyed much of the block where she chose to live. She takes a long view, remembering exploring the foundations of burned houses, finding bottles, pieces of metal and other elements for her art. “That’s how history is made,” she said. “Something destroys something the way it is, and a new thing is built up.” , Advertisement"

        "content": "Advertisement Supported by Critic’s Pick In a show at the New York Historical, Arlene Gottfried carries on the tradition of Arbus and Winogrand in the ’70s and ’80s, but with unalloyed sympathy for her subjects. By Arthur Lubow Arlene Gottfried was drawn to everyday folks who sparkled with the flair of performers. And through her eyes, New York took on the excitement of a circus. In her heyday, during the 1970s and 1980s, she prowled the city with her camera, finding colorful characters who responded with a knowing urban gaze. Typically, they were Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Jews and gays. In the neighborhoods where she lived and hung out — the Lower East Side, East Harlem, Crown Heights, Coney Island and Greenwich Village — these groups mixed freely, brewing up a heady cocktail that intoxicated her, as can be seen in “Picture Stories: Photographs by Arlene Gottfried,” a small, tantalizing exhibition at the New York Historical, to commemorate its recent acquisition of nearly 300 of Gottfried’s photographs. She arrived at the tail end of the comet of New York Street photography, a tradition blazed by many artists who have enjoyed greater recognition: Helen Levitt, Louis Faurer, Weegee, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Lee Friedlander, Joel Meyerowitz and Tod Papageorge. For about a decade, until she died in 2017 at age 66 of breast cancer, she lived in Westbeth, the subsidized artist residence in the West Village, which was also Arbus’s final home. A native of Brooklyn, Gottfried earned a precarious freelance living. She possessed two essential skills: spotting intriguing people and winning their trust. Sometimes, also like Arbus, she maintained long-term relationships with her subjects, most significantly with a magnetic dancer and nightclub entertainer called Midnight, whose sad descent into schizophrenia she intimately recorded over 20 years. She loved to depict the clothes that defined identities, especially if she found a fashion clash. When two soignée ladies in furs came face to face with Rick James, the funk-punk singer famous for his outrageous haberdashery, Gottfried captured the startled look of alarm on one woman’s face. Probably her most famous photo, an only-in-New-York moment, depicts a heavily garbed Hasidic Jew who has somehow wandered onto a nudist beach at Jacob Riis Park, in Queens, only to be accosted by a stark-naked posing bodybuilder. Cheekily hilarious, it is included in a video but is not one of the 33 prints on the wall in “Picture Stories.” A touching portrait she made around 1990, of a big-eyed, brown-skinned little girl holding a brown-skinned doll, led Gottfried to a sideline that, although tragically initiated, proved deeply satisfying. Shortly after she took the photograph, the child was murdered. Afterward, Gottfried began attending Sunday services at the Spanish Harlem church where the girl’s mother sang, and eventually joined the choir. A video of Gottfried performing a gospel number reveals that she was an extraordinary vocalist. No matter how over-the-top her subjects were, Gottfried portrayed them without the slightest condescension or mockery. The older sister of the eccentric comedian Gilbert Gottfried, she felt comfortable with unconventional people, and they evidently reciprocated. She shot a portrait of a fire-eater practicing his act at a men’s bathroom in a disco. Looking at the two urinals behind him, you wonder, how did she make her way in there? Gilbert’s widow, Dara Gottfried, cataloged the pictures in her sister-in-law’s archive and helped arrange the acquisition by the museum. The images document fabulous unknowns, New Yorkers who don’t belong to the elite and may be struggling to get by but are, at the moment Gottfried encounters them, emphatically enjoying their lives. Other than James, the closest thing to a celebrity in this show is a frequent Gottfried subject, Marsha P. Johnson, the gay activist and drag performer — a prominent figure in the Stonewall uprising of 1969 — who stands shoulder to shoulder with a shy boy holding roses. Three young men with resplendent Afros pose by a Spanish Harlem tenement that has been adorned with a vibrant street mural. A self-confident older woman in a bathing suit and sneakers rests between two beachside boulders. A little boy is flamboyantly dressed for Halloween as a member of the band Kiss. The photographer’s delight in the people in front of her camera is transparent. In a portrait that is emblematic of her art, Gottfried photographed a circus entertainer dressed in a top hat and white tie, accompanied by his two canine partners, also formally attired, the large Doberman pinscher in a white tie and a turban, the miniature pinscher with a frilly collar. The small dog is watchful, the big one is beaming. As for the man, he cracks a wry smile. He knows that it is all a little ridiculous, but he’s loving it.

        "content": "Home » Box Office Vicky Kaushal, Rashmika Mandanna, and Akshaye Khanna led Chhaava is unstoppable at the Indian box office. It has entered the 200 crore club in only 6 days. The epic historical action film is witnessing strong trends in advance booking at the top national chains. Scroll below for the day 7 update! It is a regular working Thursday today, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti holiday has also concluded. But that does not stop Laxman Utekar‘s directorial from maintaining its strong momentum. As per the latest update, Chhaava has sold a whopping 1.21 lakh tickets via advance booking on day 7. It has sold 66.6K tickets at PVR INOX, which continues to witness the highest footfalls. Around 20.9K tickets have been sold at Cinepolis, followed by MovieMax (9.6K), Miraj (12.7K), MovieTime (4.6K), and Rajhans Cinemas (6.9K). A day before the holiday in Maharashtra, Chhaava had sold 1.14 lakh tickets on Tuesday. In comparison, it continues its upward graph with almost 7% higher footfalls, which is a very good sign. It is to be noted that the Vicky Kaushal starrer raked in box office collections of 24.10 crores on day 5. Does this mean another 20 crore+ day is on the cards? Hopefully, that milestone will be achieved with high occupancy during the evening and night shows nationwide. Chhaava registered a morning occupancy of 17.25%. This has remained similar to Tuesday, which witnessed admissions in the range of 18%. At the domestic box office, Chhaava has earned 203.68 crores in six days. It surpassed the opening day on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti, as 32.40 crores were added to the kitty. The upcoming weekend will push the Valentine’s Day release closer to the 300 crore mark, and Vicky Kaushal will beat Uri: The Surgical Strike to find his new highest-grossing film!

Earlier this year, the Reserve Bank of India said in a press release that it was planning to initiate insolvency proceedings against Aviom India Housing Finance Pvt Ltd. RBI’s statement came after it superseded the board of directors of Aviom Housing Finance due to governance concerns and defaults in meeting various payment obligations. The RBI has appointed an administrator and an advisory committee to oversee the resolution of Aviom India Housing. Aviom Housing Finance has bank debt of around Rs 1,400 crore and non-convertible debenture (NCD) borrowings worth Rs 400 crore, people familiar with the matter had told NDTV Profit, adding that the company has a loan book of around Rs 1,800 crore, which includes loans to fictitious accounts. According to details available in the company's annual report for the financial year ending March 2024, HDFC Bank, with a Rs 71 crore outstanding, is its largest lender, while Kotak Mahindra Bank and Northern Arc Capital have also extended Rs 50 crore worth of term loans each to the company. Other major lenders include Poonawalla Fincorp and LIC Housing Finance with a Rs 40 crore exposure each. For the quarter ended June 2024, the company's net profit stood at Rs 2.97 crore, less than half of what it was a quarter ago."

        "content": "Osbourne was the latest guest on the 'The Magnificent Others with Billy Corgan' podcast Sharon Osbourne has taken aim at the K-pop industry, calling it “soul-destroying” and “a complete factory”. Osbourne was the latest guest on The Magnificent Others with Billy Corgan, the new podcast by the Smashing Pumpkins frontman. In the episode released yesterday (February 19), Corgan recalled with Osbourne a record label meeting he once attended – and how he lost his temper when he was suggested to change the band’s direction in order to appeal to audiences. “They’re trying to saw the edges off of the true weirdoes and the true one-of-a-kinders,” Corgan remarked, to which Osbourne replied: “Well, look at it now with all the Korean bands that come out, and all this K-pop.” Corgan asked Osbourne if she knows how K-pop is made, telling her an anecdote about a friend he knows who once travelled to Korea to “hang out” with people in the K-pop industry. “So they have these rooms, and literally in one room, they’ll just write choruses,” he said. “They don’t try to write a song, they just write choruses. And in another room, they have kids who are really good at writing bridges. And in another room, they have kids who are really good at writing verses.” Watch the episode below (skip to 1:31:11 for the quoted segment). Once they’re done, he added, they would “pile the stuff” and pick and choose what would go together. “It’s just a factory,” he remarked. Osbourne agreed, adding: “It’s a complete factory, and they’ll chop these kids up to make them look like more Western. And, as soon as they get old, [they’re] out! A younger one comes in, and it’s just soul-destroying. Totally soul-destroying.” Earlier in the episode, Osbourne revealed that Ozzy was “offered to go and read for Pirates Of The Caribbean“. “I’ve never said this to anyone, and I said no,” she said. “Now wouldn’t he have been perfect?” Corgan replied: “He would have been perfect! Maybe it’s not too late, but God bless.” The legendary frontman recently launched The Magnificent Others with guests such as KISS‘ Gene Simmons and former Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello for an in-depth and candid conversation about the triumphs, challenges, and pivotal moments that shaped their journeys and defined their paths. Produced by Bill Maher’s Club Random Studios, episodes are released every Wednesday. Corgan had already dabbled in podcasting but revealed that he previously lost interest when most companies wanted him to only share his past stories. Elsewhere, Sharon recently spoke to NME about Black Sabbath’s final gig – which will take place on July 5 in Birmingham – and opened up about the possibility of a biopic about the iconic metal band. Speaking about who would portray the band in a potential biopic, Sharon said: “God only knows! If it were to happen, I don’t know well-known actors would be good to do it. With these characters, you’d need to get somebody new. You can get these phenomenal actors: if you got Johnny Depp playing Ozzy, all you’d see in the movie is Johnny Depp. It has to be somebody faceless at that time.” The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.

(Bloomberg) — AD Ports Group’s negotiations to acquire the operating rights for a port in western Turkey have failed, a Turkish official said, marking a blow to the country’s ambitions of attracting investments from the United Arab Emirates. “The aim there was to get a partner for the Alsancak port and adding capital to expand it.

The government has been negotiating with AD Ports Group, controlled by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ, since 2023. Interest in Turkish assets from Gulf investors increased following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s tour to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the same year to attract investments into his $1 trillion economy. After that the UAE committed $51 billion of support in several sectors. Yet so far very few deals have been finalized. Most recently, ADQ and Bank Audi signed a definitive agreement for ADQ to acquire 96% of the share capital of Odeabank, Bank Audi’s subsidiary in Turkey. Previously, a few other deals have failed, including Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy giant Masdar’s negotiations to acquire a stake in Turkey’s Fiba Yenilenebilir Enerji and First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC’s talks with Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS. The Alsancak port, based in the western province of Izmir, has been owned by Turkey’s sovereign wealth fund TWF since 2017 and is operated by national railway company TCDD. The port was scheduled for privatization in 2004 and put out to tender in 2007. A group of investors including Hutchison Port Holdings and Global Yatirim Holding submitted the top bid of $1.28 billion but the deal was blocked by a court decision and the group later withdrew. —With assistance from Asli Kandemir.

Companies are importing non-BIS compliant gloves and selling them in the country without proper labelling, price declarations, or adherence to consumer protection norms, alleged Manmohan Singh, General Secretary of Indian Rubber Gloves Manufacturers Association (IRGMA). These are violations of rules including the Medical Device Rules (MDR) 2017, he said. The IRGMA has called for action against such practices, as mis-labelled and poor-quality examination gloves pose a threat to healthcare workers and patients, Singh told businessline, adding that they have raised this concern with several Government authorities including the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). Gloves manufactured three years ago, with an expiry date of 01/2025 were imported into India, on 12/2024, says an IRGMA letter to the regulatory authority. “As per the Notification of CDSCO Rule 31 the medical products cannot be imported and custom cleared if they have a residual shelf life of less than 60 per cent ,” the letter pointed out. The complaint letters also raised the issue of gloves that claim to be “Chemotherapy Drug Resistant”, and urged the drug regulator to verify the certification and authenticity of the product. The domestic gloves industry, an estimated ₹1000 crore segment, has been in existence for about 40 years, and comprises 45 companies, according to industry estimates. A query on the issue was sent to the drug regulatory authority by businessline, and a response is awaited. The surge of sub-standard gloves has been post-Covid, Singh said, alleging they come from Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. Recognising the problem, the Centre had imposed a ban on these imports and mandated Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification for all surgical and examination gloves, whether domestically manufactured or imported, a note from IRGMA said. The sub-standard imports do not just hurt the local industry that has invested in producing examination gloves, but also causes a revenue loss to the country, points out Singh. Giving the price differential, he said, an A-grade non-rejected glove costs about $18-$20 for 1,000 pieces, while the same quantity of rejected and substandard gloves are sold at $5-$10. This is possible “by tax evasion, misdeclarations at customs, and the illegal sale of banned chlorinated gloves,” the IRGMA alleged.

        "content": "By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN (CNN) — At the one-month mark of Donald Trump’s second term as president, his approval rating in a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS tilts negative but still lands above the level he reached at any point in his first four years in office. There are signs in the poll, though, that the warmer welcome Trump has received this time around could be fleeting, as optimism about his return to office has slipped since December. A broad majority feel the president isn’t doing enough to address the high prices of everyday goods. And 52% say he’s gone too far in using his presidential power, with similar majorities wary of his push to shutter federal agencies and elevate Elon Musk to a prominent role in his efforts to reshape the government. Americans divide on Trump’s performance in office thus far, with 47% approving and 52% disapproving, below the start-of-term ratings for any recent presidency other than his own. For most of the public, Trump’s actions are lining up with their expectations: Three-quarters say his handling of the presidency has been in line with what they expected while 25% say he’s handled it in an unexpected way, similar to how people felt a few weeks into his first term. All told, 41% say both that Trump is handling the presidency as expected and that his living up to their expectations is a positive. Nearly all of those who feel caught off guard describe that as a bad thing, but the group who feels surprised in a bad way by Trump’s actions makes up only 21% of all Americans. Pessimism on the rise Most adults nationwide, 55%, say that Trump has not paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems and 62% feel he has not gone far enough in trying to reduce the price of everyday goods. Sizable shares across party lines share the latter view, including 47% of Republicans, 65% of independents and 73% of Democrats. In CNN’s January polling, the economy eclipsed all other issues as Americans’ top concern. More describe themselves as pessimistic or afraid when looking ahead to the rest of Trump’s second term (54%) than say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic about it (46%). In December, 52% were on the positive side, 48% negative. Notably, the share saying they feel “afraid” has climbed 6 points to 35%, rising by a roughly equal share across partisan lines. Trump’s support also appears to be fading among some traditionally Democratic-leaning demographic groups with whom he made inroads in last year’s election. A January CNN poll found that 57% of 18–34-year-olds, 50% of Hispanic adults and 30% of Black adults approved of the way he was handling the presidential transition. Now that Trump has taken office, his approval ratings with those groups stand at 41% among younger and Hispanic adults and 23% among Black adults. Hispanic and Black adults are notably more likely than Whites to also say that Trump has handled the presidency in a way they did not expect (35% among Hispanic adults and 30% among Black adults compared with 20% among White adults), and to see that as a bad thing (29% among Hispanic people and 24% among Black people vs. 16% among White people). Wariness of Trump’s push for power About half of all Americans feel that Trump has overstepped in using the power of the presidency and the executive branch (52% say he has gone too far in doing so, 39% that he’s been about right and 8% that he hasn’t gone far enough). Broad majorities of Democrats (87%) and independents (57%) see him as going too far in using the presidency’s powers. Republicans largely disagree but few of Trump’s own partisans are clamoring for him to go further than he has already: 75% say his use of presidential power has been about right, 11% think he’s gone too far and 13% that he hasn’t gone far enough. Sizable shares are skeptical about his efforts to trim government programs and shut down federal agencies. About half (48%) say he’s gone too far in changing the way the US government works, with 32% saying his approach has been about right and 19% that it hasn’t gone far enough. Larger shares say he’s gone too far in cutting federal government programs (51%), that it’s a bad thing that he has attempted to shut down entire agencies such as the US Agency for International Development and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (53%) and that it’s bad he gave Musk a prominent role in his administration (54%). Trump’s suggestion that the US take over Gaza and keep Palestinians from returning there is the least popular of the early proposals he’s put forth that were tested in the poll. Overall, 58% call that a bad idea, including 86% of Democrats, 60% of independents and 27% of Republicans. A plurality of Republicans take a neutral position on it (47% call it neither good nor bad), and just 26% call it a good thing. Some of the president’s early moves, though, draw more muted opposition. On deporting immigrants living in the US illegally, 39% say Trump’s approach has been about right with another 16% saying he hasn’t gone far enough, together outpacing the 45% who say Trump has gone too far on that score. And 42% call it a bad thing that Trump has sought to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the federal government, modestly outpacing the 37% saying it’s a good thing, with 20% neutral on the matter. Frustrated opposition Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are broadly dissatisfied with the response to Trump by Democrats in Congress. Nearly three-quarters (73%) say the party’s caucus in Congress is doing too little to oppose Trump, with just 22% saying they’re doing the right amount and 5% that they’re overdoing it. Republicans and Republican-aligned independents, meanwhile, largely see the congressional GOP as doing the right amount to back the president (64%), with another 24% saying they do too little to support him and 12% too much. Republican-aligned adults of color are somewhat more likely than White adults who are Republican-aligned to say the party is doing too much to support Trump (21% among Republicans/Republican-leaning independents of color vs. 8% among Republican-aligned Whites). The sense of urgency Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents feel is evident in their views on the stakes of Trump’s time in office. In the new poll, 70% of Democratic-aligned adults said they view American democracy as under attack, up from 49% who felt that way in the fall of 2023, and 63% say they feel afraid as they look ahead to the rest of Trump’s term. Democratic-aligned adults who say democracy is under attack are far more likely than other Democratic-leaners to say their party’s response to Trump is inadequate (82% say so compared with 58% among those who feel democracy is under threat rather than attack). That view from the left contrasts sharply with the view from the GOP. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, just 23% see American democracy as under attack, down from 61% who said the same about a year and a half ago, and 87% describe themselves as either enthusiastic or optimistic about Trump’s coming time in office. With many of the Trump administration’s early actions already facing legal challenges, the poll also finds few Americans have deep trust in the Supreme Court to make the right decisions on any legal cases relating to the Trump administration. Just 41% overall have at least a moderate amount of trust in the high court, peaking at 66% among Republicans. But few in any party express a great deal of trust in the Court to handle any cases on the subject: 19% of Republicans, 7% of independents and 6% of Democrats feel that way. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from February 13-17 among a random national sample of 1,206 adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

        "content": "By Nathaniel Meyersohn, CNN New York (CNN) — President Donald Trump’s administration wants to roll back virtually all of former president Joe Biden’s policies. So it may come as a surprise that the Trump administration is keeping a key Biden framework designed to rein in Corporate America. New Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson said Tuesday that the Trump administration would continue using Biden-era guidelines to review proposed mergers and acquisitions. These guidelines are not legally binding, but they are an important tool that provide guidance to companies, courts and agencies about how the FTC and Justice Department review whether deals harm competition. The FTC and Justice Department’s joint merger guidelines from 2023 “are in effect and are the framework for this agency’s merger-review analysis,” Ferguson said in a memo to staff. The merger guidelines— the first update to how the US government reviews mergers in more than a decade — encouraged tighter scrutiny of mergers’ impact on worker pay and online markets. They were part of the Biden administration’s aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement under FTC Chair Lina Khan and Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter. The Biden administration challenged a number of major mergers, going after tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Meta. The FTC under Khan enraged business leaders, who accused the agency of stifling innovation and competition. Corporate America was happy to see Khan gone and salivated at the prospect of looser enforcement under Trump. Some predicted a new administration would unleash a wave of mergers. “The merger guidelines were extraordinarily unpopular in the business community. They gave the government a lot of flexibility to bring cases,” said Vadim Brusser, an antitrust attorney at Sidley Austin. “There was thought that a Republican administration would potentially scale them back.” It’s yet to be seen how Trump’s administration treats corporate tie-ups and interprets the 2023 merger guidelines. Vice President JD Vance and a handful of other Republicans had praised Khan. And in addition to his announcement Tuesday, FTC’s Ferguson recently tapped a deputy known as an aggressive antitrust enforcer. The government has already moved to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks, the first deal to be challenged by Trump’s antitrust enforcers and a potential bellwether for how the Trump administration will handle mergers. Ferguson said the agency was keeping the guidelines to “prize stability” for both businesses and enforcement agencies. “If merger guidelines change with every new administration, they will become largely worthless to businesses and the courts. No business can plan for the future on the basis of guidelines they know are one election away from rescission,” he said. Advocates of stricter FTC enforcement were encouraged by Ferguson’s memo. Tuesday’s announcement is “a pretty big step in the revival of antitrust,” said Nidhi Hegde, the executive director of American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit organization. “It shows that there is bipartisan support for this approach to how we think about mergers and markets. That’s the signal that was sent.” But business allies and supporters of tech companies criticized the announcement. “It is very unfortunate that the new Trump administration is doubling down on the highly flawed” merger guidelines, Joseph Coniglio at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology think tank, said in a statement Tuesday. “These guidelines constitute a transparent attempt to reinstate a failed merger policy that harmed innovation, competition, and consumers.” However, just because the FTC is keeping the merger guidelines does not mean Ferguson will challenge mergers as aggressively as Khan did, or that the Trump FTC’s enforcement priorities will be the same. It’s also possible there will be a hollowing out of resources at the FTC. “I think what this signals is the current FTC would like all the tools that the 2023 guidelines offer them with respect to enforcement,” Brusser from Sidley Austin said. “The FTC likes this quiver with all its arrows.” The-CNN-WireTM & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

NOT FOR USE BY NEWSPAPERS BASED IN THE UK. Copyright: xmpi34x instar54032154 Remember Derek Jeter? He, who spent his entire 20-year career with the New York Yankees? He’s now being questioned about his defensive abilities. In response, American television broadcaster and Yankees’ insider Rich Eisen has hit back at those who consider the award a popularity contest; otherwise, Jeter wouldn’t have gotten it. Sounds fair? Well, Derek Jeter, the Yankees’ shortstop, had a .310 batting average, with 260 home runs, 1311 RBIs, and .817 OPS. Although Jeter had a good run in his career, many considered him an overrated defender. Strange to say, isn’t it? However, Jeter did break into the top 10 shortstop list of all time. In addition, it named him, as the face of the dynasty in the biggest market world. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad After the Boston Red Sox signed Alex Bregman for a three-year, $120 million contract, there’s a chance of Rafael Devers shifting from third base to second base. Now that Devers has confirmed, there will be no change in Bregman’s position. A former Yankee, Derek Jeter believes the Red Sox might have to play him out of position. While he is against it, a panelist during “The Rich Eisen Show” mentioned that Jeter received the Gold Glove award because it was a popularity contest. Ouch! However, MLB insider Rich Eisen supported Jeter, saying, “He was an excellent fielder at the position... He inspired a whole youth movement of excellent fielders, who wear number two, including your new second baseman. My bad. The one who needs to change positions because the guy with 15 errors says this is my spot.” Is Derek Jeter's defensive legacy unfairly criticized, or is there truth to the overrated claims? Debate And, oh, yes, even people who don’t follow baseball would have heard the name, Derek Jeter. In a much-storied franchise like the New York Yankees, Jeter had a stunning 3000 hits, a franchise record. He’s no ordinary player, you know! Going by his statement, Eisen highlighted how Derek Jeter played a massive role in inspiring a lot of youths and strengthened the performances of infielders, too. It included Alex Bregman, esteemed to be the second baseman for the Red Sox. Eisen pointed out a player with 15 errors, Rafael Devers. The man doesn’t want to change position despite knowing that third base remains Bregman’s favorite position. And that’s why Rich Eisen seems to be against the attacks pointed toward Derek Jeter’s abilities amid the Bregman-Devers saga. So, what lies ahead for the Red Sox? Soon after getting signed by the Boston Red Sox, Alex Bregman has been all over the news, as he’s assumed to play the hot corner. As per reports, the Red Sox’s current third baseman, Rafael Devers, has confirmed his disagreement to shift his position. He clearly mentioned that the third base was his usual position. Devers’ teammates also gave him a vote of confidence by sharing their opinion on Bregman playing at second base. However, Bregman seems less bothered about the talks, doesn’t he? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Significantly, Alex Bregman shared about playing together during spring training, fielding ground balls together, and communicating with Devers. Nevertheless, he also mentioned he would like to play wherever the team needs him. An ultimate team player might be on the cards. The former Houston Astros’ All-Star Bregman displayed a moderate performance in 2024, where he posted 75 RBIs at an average of .260, with 26 homers and a .768 OPS. Although his offensive production dipped a lot, Bregman would like to join hands with starting pitcher Garrett Crochet, Walker Buehler, and others to make a significant mark on his new team.

        "content": "As administration cuts off resources from African countries to contain outbreak, workers say ‘everybody’s lost’ As the Trump administration dismantles the US Agency for International Development (USAid) and retreats from funding global public health efforts, mpox – formerly known as monkeypox – is at greater risk of becoming a wider global emergency, according to aid workers and global health experts. “It’s a real mistake not to be doing everything we can to control this while we’re still able to,” said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University focusing on risk assessment of infectious diseases. “Taking huge steps backwards is only going to make everything worse.” The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern last August as cases rose in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and spread to neighboring countries in Africa. USAid has been working to contain the virus through vaccination, testing and surveillance efforts on the ground. Last year, USAid and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contributed $55m in emergency assistance. But USAid workers with knowledge of the agency’s mpox response said that not all of that money has been disbursed and is now frozen under the administration’s orders to stop nearly all humanitarian aid. In addition to the funding freeze, USAid workers were evacuated from the country at the end of January, according to court filings. Until weeks ago, the United States was a leader in coordinating response efforts. One USAid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said in planning meetings: “Immediately it’s eyes on USAid of, ‘What are you guys going to do?’ And so everybody’s lost right now.” The aid freeze has meant that some provinces in the country who depend solely on USAid funds have been stripped of any resources to contain the virus, the worker said. “We were working on creating a sustainable system that can respond not just to the current mpox outbreak but can be used in the future for any other outbreak and now we’re not sure if that will succeed,” said a second USAid worker with knowledge of the mpox response. “Just like all these increased cases of Ebola and Marburg in neighboring countries, it’s not if, but when the next one in the DRC will be and how the country is going to be ready.” Cutting off resources to contain the current outbreak only increases the chances of mpox spreading to more countries, experts said. “Disaster and catastrophe are the appropriate words for shutting down USAid. It’s not just about people overseas who will be affected but there’s a likelihood of mpox or the next pandemic spreading to the United States,” said a US-based researcher who studies infectious diseases and asked for anonymity because of ongoing projects with the National Institutes of Health and CDC. A global outbreak of mpox in 2022 led to more than 100,000 cases in 122 countries and marked the first time that the disease had spread outside of central or western Africa. That outbreak has largely been contained and the number of cases is low, in part due to widespread vaccination efforts. The more recent outbreak in DRC is a distinct variant from the mpox virus that caused the 2022 outbreak. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio issued guidance that life-saving humanitarian assistance – including for food and medicine – may still be dispersed through a waiver despite the funding freeze. USAid workers said that while they have been seeking a waiver to continue mpox programming in the DRC, one had not been approved yet. While Trump administration officials have said their aim is to reduce wasteful spending and fraud, public health researchers criticized the speed and ferocity of the cuts. “If you’re gonna do these types of cuts, they have to be mindful,” said Amesh Adalja, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of public health. “There’s this unpredictability that you can’t have if you’re trying to run a disease control program.” Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion A lot of organizations are dependent on USAid funding. When that’s pulled, Adalja explained, “making decisions about vaccine allocation, vaccine programs, testing strategies, is missing expert input, and that makes it harder for it makes it harder for control efforts”. While much of the agency’s programming remains halted, the future of USAid continues to be challenged in court cases. One federal judge ruled last Thursday that the aid freeze must be temporarily halted and gave the government five days to comply. Aid workers said the ruling has created confusion on how to restart programs that may be simply axed again shortly. Though USAid employees said in interviews they are most concerned about finding ways to continue the agency’s aid work, the last several weeks have been personally taxing as well, according to court testimony. Three USAid workers described the chaos of being pulled from the Democratic Republic of Congo on 28 January as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing federal workers. After protests broke out in Kinshasa, the embassy issued an order to evacuate. But with foreign aid frozen, Washington offices closed and many colleagues placed on administrative leave, USAid employees had little communication and were forced to fund their own evacuations. Workers described being shuttled into boats with their families with just enough space to hold a carry-on bag each on their laps or a backpack – many leaving pets and most of their belongings behind. Now, back in Washington, their careers still remain in limbo. “I have been experiencing health consequences related to extreme stress, anguish and sleep deprivation due to worrying about staff, partners and the situation in general in DRC and not being able to respond in the way that I normally would,” a USAid employee using the pseudonym Nancy Doe said in a 11 February filing. Morse, the professor at Columbia University, notes that the US pulling out from the WHO in tandem to shutting down USAid work is a “double hit”. The United States was the biggest donor of the WHO and also benefited from sharing research with other countries it will no longer be privy to. “If we blindfold ourselves and tie our hands, we’re not going to make ourselves safer,” said Morse. “We will just be less aware of what’s killing us or what’s making us sick.”"

        "content": "By Ben Norton (Posted Feb 20, 2025) It is now widely acknowledged that the world is multipolar. This is so uncontroversial that the Munich Security Conference chose the title “Multipolarization” for its 2025 annual report. However, there is not a common definition of “multipolarity”. The Munich Security Report noted that, while “the world’s ‘multipolarization’ is a fact”, the “international system shows elements of unipolarity, bipolarity, multipolarity, and nonpolarity”, in which “multiple order models co-exist, compete, or clash”. Governments have radically different understandings of the meaning of multipolarity. The definition used by the United States, and especially by the Donald Trump administration, is the opposite of the idea of multipolarity advocated by China. When China talks about a multipolar world, it means one without imperialism and without hegemony, with “equality among all countries regardless of size”, where all nations have an equal voice in multilateral institutions and can pursue their own independent path of development, without foreign intervention. “Rivalry between big powers had brought disaster to humanity”, warned China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi. “Equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules should become the basic principles of a multipolar world”, he argued, calling for “greater democracy in international relations”. This is a view shared by many Global South countries. Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega, the leader of the Sandinista Revolution, has an anti-imperialist view of multipolarity. He argued that “a new order is being born in the world that buries imperialism, buries the colonialists, and opens the way to a democracy of nations, a multipolarism that is manifesting itself in various ways”, but he cautioned that, on the other hand, we see North American imperialism trying to maintain its hegemony at all costs, even at the risk of sinking its own economy. The view in Washington could hardly be more different. When U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio talks about multipolarity, he means that there are now other great powers capable of challenging U.S. dominance. The conclusion of the Trump administration is that the U.S. must re-assert its imperial “sphere of influence” in the Western hemisphere. This is why Trump is so aggressively threatening Greenland, Canada, Mexico, Panama, and other countries in Latin America. In other words, China has an anti-imperialist view of a multipolar world, whereas Trump and Rubio believe it means a return to “great power competition” and “inter-imperialist rivalry”. Beijing sees multipolarity as a desirable step toward international cooperation and development that will encourage peace; Washington sees multipolarity as a threat to its hegemony that will foster further conflict. In the 1990s, the world was overwhelmingly dominated by the United States, which could impose its will on most countries. The overthrow of the Soviet Union and its socialist allies meant there was no longer a counterbalance to U.S. hegemony. Neoconservative pundits like the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer declared this to be “the unipolar moment”. Nevertheless, he warned in 1990: Enjoy it now. It won’t last long. When exactly the unipolar moment ended has been hotly debated. Some argue it was the North Atlantic financial crisis of 2007-09. Others say it was the conflict in Ukraine, which started with a U.S.-backed coup in 2014 and escalated into a Russia-NATO proxy war in 2022. Other important developments include the founding of BRICS in 2009, as well as the rapid economic growth in China, which became the “world’s sole manufacturing superpower” and in 2016 overtook the U.S. as the biggest economy on Earth, when its GDP is measured at purchasing power parity. It is too simplistic to say U.S. unipolarity ended in one specific moment, but, regardless, by the 2020s, it was no longer debatable that the world was multipolar. Neoconservative war hawks like Marco Rubio reluctantly recognized this reality, but they saw it as a tragedy–and a threat. Today, “we do have near-peer adversaries”, Rubio lamented in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in 2022. We didn’t 25 years ago; the United States lived in a unipolar world, where we were the only show in town. “Now, there are at least one unprecedented near-peer adversary”, Rubio said. The Chinese Communist Party is a challenge to the United States unlike, greater even than what the Soviet Union was, because they are a commercial rival, a technological rival, a geopolitical rival, a diplomatic rival, and an economic and commercial one. And in addition to all of that, they are also a military threat to the country, as they continue to develop. The U.S. Department of Defense dubbed this “great power competition”. The Pentagon warned in 2019 that the “United States enjoys a lead there now, but other nations are nipping at its heels”. China has criticized Washington’s rhetoric about “competition”. Instead, Beijing has promoted what it calls “mutual benefit and win-win cooperation”. At an event in 2023, China’s ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, emphasized, President Xi Jinping has proposed the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win cooperation. China has made it clear that it does not want to create an empire, and it is not seeking to replace U.S. hegemony with Chinese hegemony. When China talks about multipolarity, its means a world without imperialism and without hegemony. This is a definition that is shared by many countries in the Global South, and in BRICS in particular. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi articulated his nation’s view of multipolarity in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025. The world is “headed toward multipolarization”, Wang said. “When the United Nations was founded 80 years ago, it had only 51 member states; today, 193 countries ride in the same big boat”. “A multipolar world is not only a historical inevitability; it is also becoming a reality”, argued the Chinese foreign minister. Nevertheless, Wang insisted that multipolarity should not “bring chaos, conflict and confrontation”, and it must not “mean domination by major countries and the strong bullying the weak”. “China’s answer is, we should work for an equal and orderly multipolar world”, Wang said. In China’s view, multipolarity should have four characteristics: The Chinese foreign minister explained (emphasis added): Rivalry between big powers had brought disaster to humanity, as evidenced by the lessons of the two world wars in the not-so-distant past. Whether it is the colonial system or the core-periphery structure, unequal orders are bound to meet their demise. Independence and autonomy is sought across the world, and greater democracy in international relations is unstoppable. Equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules should become the basic principles of a multipolar world. It is in this principle that China advocates equality among all countries regardless of size, and calls for increasing the representation and say of developing countries in the international system. This will not lead to “Westlessness,” but will deliver more positive-sum results to the world. ... Every country should have their voice heard. Every country should be able to find their place and play their role in a multipolar paradigm. China’s understanding of multipolarity is the opposite of that promoted by the United States. Marco Rubio’s acknowledgment that the world is multipolar is by no means a sign that the United States is abandoning its imperialist ambitions. On the contrary. The Trump administration has made it clear that it sees the Western hemisphere as part of the U.S. imperial “sphere of influence”, and it wants to forcibly impose U.S. hegemony and minimize Chinese influence in the region. This is why Trump has vowed to colonize Greenland, despite the fact that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and just 6% do. It is why Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of turning Canada into the “51st state”. It is why Trump has been especially aggressive in Latin America, pledging to colonize the Panama Canal, deliberating plans to invade Mexico, attacking Colombia, and threatening Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba. In his inauguration speech, Trump invoked the colonialist idea of “Manifest Destiny”, and he promised to “expand our territory”. At an event on January 25, the U.S. president told supporters he wants a “very substantially enlarged country”: We may be a very substantially enlarged country in the not too distant [future]—isn’t it nice to see? You know, for years, for decades, we’re the same size to the square foot–probably got smaller, actually–but we might be an enlarged country pretty soon. Trump allies have frequently invoked the 202-year-old Monroe Doctrine, which treats Latin America as the colonial “backyard” of the U.S. empire. They have threatened Latin American leaders and told them to cut ties with China and Russia. Rubio’s first foreign trip as U.S. secretary of state was to Panama, where he successfully pressured the Central American nation to withdraw from China’s global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. The Associated Press summarized Rubio’s message to Panama: Immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the Panama Canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States. Rubio subsequently traveled to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic, where his threat was the same: minimize your relations with China, or else the U.S. empire will attack you. Marco Rubio did his first interview as U.S. secretary of state in January, with the conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly. Some Trump supporters pointed to Rubio’s remarks to claim that he has supposedly moved away from his warmongering neoconservative past, and has instead become a foreign-policy “realist”. But they took his comments out of context. In the interview, Rubio stated: It’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power... That was an anomaly. It was the product of the end of the Cold War. But eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, [with] multi great powers in different parts of the planet. We face that now with China, and to some extent Russia, and then you have rogue states like Iran and North Korea you have to deal with. In context, what these remarks demonstrated is that Rubio’s definition of multipolarity is totally different from that of China. The secretary of state sees the U.S. empire as in a “great power competition” with China and Russia. In fact, Rubio spent much of his interview with Megyn Kelly fearmongering about China. He mentioned the words “China” or “Chinese” 65 times in roughly one hour. Rubio framed his foreign-policy strategy as an all-encompassing attempt to weaken China. “China wants to be the most powerful country in the world and they want to do so at our expense, and that’s not in our national interest, and we’re going to address it”, Rubio declared. The secretary of state falsely claimed that China controls the Panama Canal, echoing the rhetoric of Trump, who falsely stated in his inauguration speech, “China is operating the canal” and “we’re taking it back”. When asked why the Trump administration is targeting Greenland, Rubio said it is to counter China and to prevent Beijing from having influence in the Arctic region. His answer, according to the official State Department transcript, follows (emphasis added): Well, the Arctic, which has gotten very little attention, but the Arctic Circle and the Arctic region is going to become critical for shipping lanes, for how you get some of this energy that’s going to be produced under President Trump—these energies rely on shipping lanes. The Arctic has some of the most valuable shipping lanes in the world. As some of the ice is melting, it’s become more and more navigable. We need to be able to defend that. So if you project what the Chinese have done, it is just a matter of time before—because they are not an Arctic power. They do not have an Arctic presence, so they need to be able to have somewhere that they can stage from. And it is completely realistic to believe that the Chinese will eventually—maybe even in the short term—try to do in Greenland what they have done at the Panama Canal and in other places, and that is install facilities that give them access to the Arctic with the cover of a Chinese company but that in reality serve a dual purpose: that in a moment of conflict, they could send naval vessels to that facility and operate from there. And that is completely unacceptable to the national security of the world and to the United—to the security of the world and the national security of the United States. So the question becomes: If the Chinese begin to threaten Greenland, do we really trust that that is not a place where those deals are going to be made? Do we really trust that that is not a place where they would not intervene, maybe by force? In short, the Trump administration says it must colonize the Panama Canal, Greenland, and other foreign lands because of hypothetical threats that they imagine China could pose one day. This year, Brazil and China celebrate fifty years of official diplomatic relations. The importance of the Sino-Brazilian relationship cannot be underestimated in the context of the rise of the Global South, the decline of U.S. hegemony, and the emergence of a New Cold War. With a look back into the history of bilateral relations, how [...] In this republished essay from 2017, John Bellamy Foster discusses how U.S. neofascism in certain ways resembles the classical fascism of Italy and Germany in the 1920s and ’30s, but with historically distinct features specific to the political economy and culture of the United States in the opening decades of the twenty-first century.

        "content": "Should the Steelers have interest in RB Nick Chubb? Steelers HC Mike Tomlin respects Cleveland Browns RB Nick Chubb so much, he calls him Mr. But even the most respected person in the world is susceptible to a severe blow to the knee. In a game against the Steelers in 2023, Chubb suffered just such an injury. While he returned to play in the second half of last season, he wasn’t himself. He averaged just 3.3 yards per carry with a 41.7-percent success rate, wildly below his previous numbers. Prior to last season, Chubb averaged 5.3 yards per carry and a 48.4-percent success rate. Against the Steelers, historically, he had a career 4.5-yard average. Chubb is an unrestricted free agent, but the Browns don’t seem in a rush to stand by him. Injuries are an unfortunate part of the business, though, and isn’t their fault. They owe him nothing. But if the Browns aren’t thinking about re-signing him, why should the Steelers? If there is a logic here, it is obviously the hope that, more than a full season removed from his injury, Nick Chubb can regain some of his former glory. He probably won’t ever be the same elite running back he was. But the Steelers aren’t working from the highest plateau, so he could still be an upgrade. And the Steelers have the potential to completely remake their running back room, if they so choose. Najee Harris is an unrestricted free agent, and Jaylen Warren is restricted. Cordarrelle Patterson is a potential salary cap casualty. If they don’t re-sign Harris and they cut Patterson, then a veteran back makes sense. But does it make sense for the Steelers to sign Nick Chubb, specifically? Even though he returned and played the last eight games of the 2024 season, it would depend on his medicals. The Steelers are generally not afraid of players with injuries, including free agents, and they have tremendous respect for Chubb. But respecting what somebody has done in the past doesn’t mean they can do that for you in the future. The Steelers’ 2024 season has come to its predictably inauspicious end, with yet another one-and-done postseason for HC Mike Tomlin. The offense faltered, and the defense matched it blow for blow, leading to a 21-0 first-half deficit. Just like last year, the biggest question hanging over the Steelers is the quarterback question. Do they still believe in Russell Wilson, and/or Justin Fields, or do they want another solution? There are other major decisions to make, as well, such as what to do with George Pickens. Do you sign him to an extension, try to trade him, or let him play out his rookie contract? The Steelers started the 2024 season 10-3, with Mike Tomlin in the Coach of the Year conversation. Wash, rinse, and repeat, and we have another late-season collapse. This may be the worst yet, a four-game losing streak presaging a one-and-done playoff “run”. Welcome to Steelers football.

Mandatory Credit: Brett Davis-Imagn Images On February 19, 2025, the Lakers suffered a gut-punch loss to the Hornets, 100-97. It wasn’t just any loss. It was a meltdown. A full-on razing of a 12-point lead, getting annihilated by a 22-1 run. I’m sure as frustrating as the collapse was, what happened after the game will emerge as the greater concern. A bigger issue, however, was something head coach JJ Redick didn’t hold back in talking about. In the third quarter, things were fine, the Lakers were up by 65-53 late. Their offense then flipped a switch and went completely cold. The Hornets were all pumped by the time they scored 10 straight shots. LaMelo Ball contributed 27 points and orchestrated everything, and Miles Bridges went off with 29 points as the Hornets got a massive win. The Lakers, meanwhile, just couldn’t put it together. James had 21 points but missed two crucial shots at the end. Luka Doncic had an abysmal night as he failed to find his Midas touch. After the game, Redick kept it real: This is a new challenge, and he wants the Lakers to figure it out fast. “Sometimes when the group is trying to get acclimated with each other, you can try to play the right way too much and turn down shots, and then you can try to get yourself in a rhythm and not make the extra pass.“ ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Basically, they’re overthinking everything. Redick knows the team is still finding its rhythm, but he’s staying optimistic.“I think the flow of everything is going to happen. I’m excited because this is a new problem to solve.” Instead of stressing, he sees this as an opportunity to fine-tune their offense.“We’ll work our butts off to try to solve the problem, but I’m excited about us being able to generate that stuff, getting two on the ball. We’ll just continue to re-emphasize the type of shots we want, and I felt from the Detroit game on, on December 23rd, I’ve really liked the threes we’ve generated.” VIDEO: JJ Redick discussed the Lakers' offensive struggles in their loss to the Hornets. — Lakers Nation (@LakersNation) February 20, 2025 Expand Tweet But here’s the grave issue—LeBron James isn’t exactly on board with Redick’s game plan. This isn’t the first time LeBron has had a coach who wants him to shoot more threes. And guess what? He’s not loving the idea this time, either. Redick has been pushing for a more modern offense—spacing, ball movement, and more threes. But LeBron is one of the best interior scorers ever, and shifting to a high-volume three-point game? Yeah, that’s not exactly his thing. Can LeBron adapt to Redick's three-point strategy, or is this a recipe for disaster? Debate LeBron has been a fan of Luka Doncic for years, going back to 2018 when he first talked about wanting to play with him. Now, they’re finally teammates, and the expectations are sky-high. But they’re still figuring things out. “Everybody getting into the right spots, hold each other accountable, play basketball the right way, share the ball. The ball is gonna be in Luka’s hands, it’s gonna be in AR’s hands. Two great decision makers. It’d be in my hands a little bit as well. Another great decision-maker and then our guys are gonna feast off us,” LeBron said. “ So, he’s open to adjusting his role... but when it comes to shooting more threes? Not so much. Just recently, after dropping 42 points on the Warriors—becoming just the second player ever (after Michael Jordan!) to score 40+ points at 40 years old—LeBron admitted Redick wants him to let it fly from deep.”JJ still wants me to shoot more threes. I’m still reluctant to do that ’cause I’m just playing an all-around game... I don’t know, maybe we’ll see.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad It’s an interesting standoff. Redick wants a modernized offense, built around spacing and threes. But LeBron, who’s been dominating inside his entire career, doesn’t buy into the plan just yet. via Imago Feb 19, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) and guard Luka Doncic (77) during the second quarter against the Charlotte Hornets at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Jason Parkhurst-Imagn Images The Lakers’ front office is already trying to build around LeBron and Luka. They tried to bring in Mark Williams, a 7-footer who can catch lobs and finish at the rim—something Luka’s big men in Dallas did all the time. But if LeBron keeps resisting Redick’s vision, it could slow down how quickly this team finds its groove. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad With the playoffs creeping closer, the Lakers don’t have time to waste. Redick is making it crystal clear—fixing their offense is priority number one. But if LeBron won’t fully commit to the game plan, things could get complicated really fast. Now, all eyes are on Luka’s Lakers debut. If LeBron buys in, this team could be scary good. If not?

Carver High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, to unveil a powerful new mural in the school’s gymnasium. This was part of a week of activities before and during the Super Bowl. Image caption: Closeup of the mural shows Marshall Faulk (left) protecting the world from the scourge of drug abuse and addiction. The mural is a collaboration between G.W. Carver High School, Foundation for a Drug-Free World and Marshall Faulk, to stand as a lasting inspiration for students to stay focused, pursue excellence, and make positive choices for their future. It prominently features the school’s ram mascot, a tribute to G.W. Carver High’s enduring spirit, alongside its motto: “Exceed any expectation.” At the heart of the mural is Marshall Faulk, immortalized as both a legendary athlete and a champion for drug-free living. It reinforces his message that success is built on smart choices, discipline and perseverance. G.W. Carver High School, located in New Orleans’ historic 9th Ward, is known for its vibrant culture, renowned marching band, and deep-rooted community pride. Named after scientist and educator George Washington Carver, the school has a long tradition of academic excellence and leadership development. Its vision is: to prepare all scholars for college success, inspired and ready to exceed any expectation. This principle is exemplified by Faulk’s own journey from G.W. Carver High to NFL stardom. Julian Reams (IG: @jubeanski) created the mural. This is the second mural Reams has painted for Foundation for a Drug-Free World, donating his talents to promote a drug-free lifestyle. He shared his thoughts on the project: “The message and goal is to inspire youth to avoid the distraction and dangers of drugs while in school so that their potential is limitless. I enjoyed the process at G.W. Carver here in New Orleans because I was able to integrate the spirit of the people into the piece by being present during various school and community events put on daily in the gym. Hopefully when the students see it, they truly are inspired to be drug-free so they can exceed any expectation.” For years, Marshall Faulk has advocated for drug prevention, working with Foundation for a Drug-Free World to bring factual, life-saving drug education to schools, youth programs and sports organizations. Having seen firsthand the devastating effects of substance abuse, he has made it his mission to empower young people with knowledge to help them make informed choices about their future. “The one word that I always use is commitment,” Faulk told students gathered at G.W. Carver High for the mural unveiling. “Commitment requires you to do things, not just when you want to, but when you don’t want to. Your commitment is tested. What I am saying to you is the world is out there for you. You have to make the best of it. So dream big, don’t allow the world to minimize your dreams.” Through public service campaigns, speaking engagements, and hands-on community outreach, Faulk continues to spread the message that drugs are not the path to success—education, discipline, and hard work are.

Cook has been a stand-up comedian for over 15 years, and her most recent special, \"Mark Your Territory,\" premiered on Hulu and YouTube on Feb. 11.

And oftentimes, podcasters are people who present as just like, ‘I am one of you,’\" said Cook. \"Especially if it's a comedian, it feels very like, this is a person who's just like us.\" She also noted that people have a much easier time relating to comedians and podcasters, who typically present themselves as everyday people, than they would a politician or news anchor. \"This [podcaster] isn't another politician or maybe a news anchor that we don't necessarily relate to as much. And so I think that's kind of why people have turned more to podcasts for not just feeling like they trust the host more, but also, it's like a very different interview environment,\" said the comedian. \"I think the things that are being talked about are a little more laid back. Feels like potentially a more authentic interview than on a major news source.\" COMIC ARI SHAFFIR URGES AMERICANS TO PUT DOWN THE PHONE, TURN OFF THE NEWS, AND 'FIND SOME JOY' IN THE WORLD The 2024 election cycle put this idea of the public trusting podcasters over legacy media into the spotlight, with President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance allocating large portions of their time on the campaign trail to appearing on popular podcasts such as the Joe Rogan Experience and the Tim Dillon Show. This strategy paid off, with Trump winning the popular vote in 2024 and continuing to see his approval ratings at personal all-time highs after the election. Trump's interview with Joe Rogan was seen by many as a pivotal moment in the 2024 election. (The Joe Rogan Experience) Cook also touched on comedy becoming a freer medium than it ever has been, with comics having the ability to say whatever they want — whether they're on-stage or in the podcast studio — and find an audience who's interested in what they say. As Cook explained, there are no longer gatekeepers who are able to mediate what comics are able to convey to their audiences. \"I do think that comedy's become a more free medium. I think more than ever, people have been able to find their own fan base, and it doesn't necessarily have to be like, you don't have to be everybody's cup of tea,\" Cook claimed. \"I think it is becoming very free where people can kind of do what they want, say what they want, and their fans will find them.\" As far as stand-up comedy, Cook feels that the biggest reason for its recent surge in popularity was the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in people paying more attention to social media and streaming services than ever before. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"I think the thing that's probably helped comedy explode the most was probably the pandemic. You know, everybody was inside on their phones watching TV, watching their phone, and that became a time for comics to make as much content as you could because there was such a demand for it,\" said Cook. Cook credits the COVID-19 pandemic with being the catalyst for the recent boom in the stand-up comedy industry. ((Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images)) The end of the pandemic was the beginning of the touring boom for stand-ups, according to Cook. Many people who found their favorite comedians via social media and streaming services during the lockdowns were finally able to see their favorite acts in person. \"I think you saw people finding their new favorite comics over the pandemic, and then once things opened back up and people could start touring again, people were like, 'great, this person's coming to my city, I've been cooped up inside for however long now, I want to go out and do stuff.' And so I think a lot of us saw a big touring boom, especially once people could go out and kind of resume normal life again.\" According to Pollstar, revenue from stand-up shows had doubled from 2022 to 2024, with the combined gross revenue among the top 25 comedians during the past year being $582.7 million.

Fox News anchor Dana Perino discusses President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's exclusive joint interview and promotes her upcoming book, 'I Wish Someone Had Told Me...' Full disclosure off the top: I was a grant maker for more than 20 years, first as a member of the California Arts Council, and then for 17 years as a member of the Children and Families Commission of Orange County, California. The California Arts Council dealt in relatively small amounts of funds appropriated by the state legislature. It was a mini-National Endowment for the Arts. By contrast, Orange County’s \"Prop 10\" Commission, as it was originally known, distributed tens of millions of dollars of cigarette tax revenue annually to grantees dedicated in some way to the mission, dictated by the language of the voter-approved initiative, of \"making children 0-5 and their families healthy and ready to learn\" by the time they began kindergarten. DOGE UNCOVERS OVER 4M GOVERNMENT CREDIT CARDS RESPONSIBLE FOR 90M TRANSACTIONS Proposition 10 was passed by the voters of California in 1998. The brainchild of actor Rob Reiner and former Republican Rep. Michael Huffington, Prop 10 laid a 50-cent tax on every pack of cigarettes. The money raised thereby was divided 20% to the state’s Prop 10 Commission, and 80% to the 58 county commissions. The 80% was divided up on a per capita basis, so Los Angeles, of course, got the most, but Orange County got a large chunk every year. Elon Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency and needs to target the temptations of grant makers. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Each county commission had to have a majority of its members from the private sector. I put up my hand to be one of the five private sector commissioners on our commission of nine because that was real money going out the door and I wanted a say in how it would be spent. The \"job\" required two meetings a month at $100 a meeting with no benefits or pension. (I may be among the very few people subject to the California CAIR Political Practices Act for more than two decades who did not accrue a pension and who lost money on every meeting.) There was a lot of homework, but the small staff was made up of superb professionals, and it was public service of the old school sort. I think Orange County’s commission, at least, did good work — blocking and tackling public health stuff, paying for school nurses for example, providing support for new mothers of limited means, etc. We audited ourselves and, 10 years in, brought in Bainbridge Strategic Consulting to survey our past work and our plans going forward and to suggest greater efficiencies. The staff was small and superb. We employed contractors whenever we could. We kept track of the pennies. I’d gladly have stayed on the commission for as long as I could do the math, but I left California for Virginia in 2016 and, of course, resigned. I keep an eye on it from afar. It is still doing good work, because it was built to resist the three great temptations of grant makers. The first temptation is to never examine the efficacy of a grant once it is made. If outcomes are not tracked and performances cannot be measured, it’s a good bet they aren’t worth reaching for. Bainbridge provided the outside eyes, but from day one the emphasis was on data-based outcomes. If a program didn’t \"work,\" it went away. The first temptation of a grant maker is to never look at what the results of previous expenditures were. If DOGE is doing at least that, good. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The second temptation is to give money to your friends. We never got close to that line because the laws in California are very strict about self-dealing, and the nine members never included any shy people. More important by far: All grants were awarded in public meetings. All were explained in the materials provided to the public. Grant making ought never to be done in half-light, much less in the dark. DOGE should be asking who made decisions to award money and who was watching. The scandal at the EPA seems to be the opposite approach. If you haven’t seen it, watch Administrator Lee Zeldin’s \"throwing gold bars off the Titanic\" video. Rushing $20 billion out the door after an election is a recipe for airmailing money to friends. I put up my hand to be one of the five private sector commissioners on our commission of nine because that was real money going out the door and I wanted a say in how it would be spent. Finally, and most obviously, the last temptation of a grant maker is self-enrichment. It should go without saying that a grant maker should never, ever give money to themselves or a family member or to an organization at which they expect to work. If DOGE finds that federal grants went out the door to recipients where the grant maker ended up working ... then DOGE should call Attorney General Pam Bondi. That’s not \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" That’s probably a crime. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The end results of DOGE are hard to predict but the bright light it is shining or promises to shine on grant making and other discretionary funding by federal agencies is much needed. Scrutiny of recipients and of rules for eligibility to assure they are clearly understood, easily explained to applicants and transparently made, is long overdue. There are no \"small grants.\" Every grant made to \"A\" is a grant not made to \"B.\" And every grant that sounds outrageous almost certainly is. Dig deep DOGE folk. The good grant makers will have nothing to fear or hide.

Team USA 4 Nations Face-Off GM Bill Guerin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the United States clinching a spot in the championship game of the tournament by beating Canada in a heated game. The 4 Nations Face-Off will finish exactly how the National Hockey League drew it up: a USA-Canada final. The two squads battled it out on Saturday in what was their first meeting in a best-on-best format in nine years, and a raucous Montreal crowd that booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was delivered an immediate treat with three fights in the first nine seconds, including two in the first three. The rivalry stretches over plenty of time, but with political tensions between the two countries, it's now hotter than ever before. Before diving into Thursday night's final, let's take a look at some of the rivalry's history and how we got to where we are today. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Canada's Brandon Hagel, left, fights United States' Matthew Tkachuk during the first period of the 4 Nations Face-Off game in Montreal on Saturday. (Graham Hughes/Canadian Press via AP) The World Juniors have been nicer to the Americans in recent years: each of the last four gold-medal games between the two countries have gone to the Americans, most recently in 2021. However, this is the big leagues. The very first meeting between the two countries in a best-on-best format was back in the 1976 Canada Cup, which Team Canada won, 4-2; the Americans did not earn their first win over their northern neighbors until the 1996 World Cup of Hockey after losing seven of their first eight meetings, and tying in the other. The U.S. won that year's World Cup, taking home the best-of-three series against Canada, but since then, it's mostly been Canadian dominance again. Entering the 4 Nations Face-Off, Canada went 6-1 against the Americans from 1998 to 2016, and three of those wins were absolute gut-punches to the United States. Canada took home the 2002 Olympic gold medal in Salt Lake City over the Americans, but more famously, Sidney Crosby's golden goal eight years later also came at the expense of Team USA in front of a Vancouver crowd. Canada forward Sidney Crosby scores the game-winning goal in overtime against the USA during the men's hockey gold medal match in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. (Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) Four years later, Canada again defeated the USA in the Olympic semifinals. The United States' only win in the aforementioned span came during group play of the 2010 Olympics, and their last meeting before last week was a 4-2 Canada win in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey in Toronto. So, it's been quite a while since the Stars and Stripes have had bragging rights. The countries' best players, though, would be on hiatus after issues with the NHL, scheduling, travel and COVID-19. But one year ago, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the new 4 Nations Face-Off was born and NHL players would go back to the Olympics in 2026 and 2030. Some skepticism came as this tournament approached, though: \"This tournament's fake. Will the players care? What if there's an injury like Edwin Diaz in the World Baseball Classic?\" But that brings us to the present day, where nearly a decade of missed opportunity plus a heated political landscape has brought the best rivalry in hockey to a new level, and that criticism is no more. USA, CANADA HOCKEY STARS WHO FOUGHT EACH OTHER THROW SUBTLE JABS AHEAD OF 4 NATIONS FINAL Beginning this month, as a response to President Donald Trump's impending tariffs against Canada on goods, Canadian crowds have booed the United States' national anthem during sporting events in which an American team is visiting. When Team USA played its first 4 Nations game last Thursday against Finland, one would have thought the game was being played overseas, even though it was in Montreal. Players and fans stand for the U.S. national anthem prior to the first period of the 4 Nations Face-Off game between Canada and the United States in Montreal on Saturday. (Christinne Muschi/Canadian Press via AP) Fast-forward to Saturday night, when the raucous crowd booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" throughout, and then gloves were dropped right at the opening face-off between U.S. star Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel of Team Canada. On the next face-off, Matthew's brother, Brady, fought Sam Bennett, who is teammates with Matthew for the Florida Panthers. Then, six seconds later, after a goalie stoppage, J.T. Miller threw hands with Colton Parayko. The already electric crowd was on fire, and even more so when Canada's Connor McDavid opened up the scoring in the first period. However, Team USA's defense showed up, and the Americans scored three unanswered goals to take home their first win against Canada in nearly 15 years. The game garnered an average of 4.4 million viewers, the most-watched non-Stanley Cup hockey game since 2019. United States players celebrate after defeating Canada in the 4 Nations Face-Off game in Montreal on Saturday. (Graham Hughes/Canadian Press via AP) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now, the two teams will go at it once again, this time in Boston for what is the hottest ticket in town. The get-in price is over $1,000, it's the best-selling NHL-sanctioned game of the season, and fans from 28 countries are buying tickets to the spectacle. Team USA has not won back-to-back contests against Canada since that 1996 series. In all, Canada owns a 13-4-1 record over the Americans, but Thursday's 4 Nations Face-Off final may just be worth 10 points. The puck drops at TD Garden at 8 p.m. ET.

        "content": "Since early 2024, ESET researchers have been tracking DeceptiveDevelopment, a series of malicious campaigns linked to North Korea-aligned operators. Disguising themselves as software development recruiters, these threat actors lure victims with fake job offers and deliver software projects embedded with infostealing malware. “As part of a fake job interview process, the DeceptiveDevelopment operators ask their targets to take a coding test, such as adding a feature to an existing project, with the files necessary for the task usually hosted on private repositories on GitHub or other similar platforms. Unfortunately for the eager work candidate, these files are trojanized: Once they download and execute the project, the victim’s computer gets compromised,” explains ESET researcher Matěj Havránek, who made the discovery and analyzed DeceptiveDevelopment. While DeceptiveDevelopment’s affiliation remains unconfirmed, its tactics closely mirror those of known North Korea-aligned cyber operations. The campaign primarily targets freelance software developers through spearphishing on job-hunting and freelancing platforms, to steal cryptocurrency wallets and login credentials from browsers and password managers. DeceptiveDevelopment employs tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) similar to other North Korea-linked operations. Its operators specifically target developers across Windows, Linux, and macOS, aiming to steal cryptocurrency for financial gain, with potential secondary objectives related to cyberespionage. To infiltrate their targets, they use fake recruiter profiles on social media, masquerading as legitimate employers. Their attacks are not geographically restricted; instead, they cast a wide net to maximize their chances of compromising victims and extracting funds and sensitive information. DeceptiveDevelopment primarily uses two malware families as part of its activities, delivered in two stages. In the first stage, BeaverTail (infostealer, downloader) acts as a simple login stealer, extracting browser databases containing saved logins, and as a downloader for the second stage, InvisibleFerret (infostealer, RAT), which includes spyware and backdoor components, and is also capable of downloading the legitimate AnyDesk remote management and monitoring software for post-compromise activities. In order to pose as recruiters, the attackers copy profiles of existing people or even construct new personas. They then either directly approach their potential victims on job-hunting and freelancing platforms, or post fake job listings there. While some of these profiles are set up by the attackers themselves, others are potentially compromised profiles of real people on the platform, modified by the attackers. Some of the platforms where these interactions occur are generic job-hunting ones, while others focus primarily on cryptocurrency and blockchain projects and are thus more in line with the attackers’ goals. The platforms include LinkedIn, Upwork, Freelancer.com, We Work Remotely, Moonlight, and Crypto Jobs List. Victims receive the project files either directly via file transfer on the site, or through a link to a repository like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. They are asked to download the files, add features or fix bugs, and report back to the recruiter. Additionally, they are instructed to build and execute the project in order to test it, which is where the initial compromise happens. The attackers often use a clever trick to hide their malicious code: They place it in an otherwise benign component of the project, usually within backend code unrelated to the task given to the developer, where they append it as a single line behind a long comment. This way, it is moved off-screen and stays mostly hidden. “The DeceptiveDevelopment cluster is an addition to an already large collection of money-making schemes employed by North Korea-aligned actors and conforms to an ongoing trend of shifting focus from traditional money to cryptocurrencies,” concludes Havránek."

        "content": "by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Human LUC7 proteins impact 5’ splice sites with distinct composition. Credit: Connor J. Kenny et al RNA splicing is a cellular process that is critical for gene expression. After genes are copied from DNA into messenger RNA, portions of the RNA that don't code for proteins, called introns, are cut out and the coding portions are spliced back together. This process is controlled by a large protein-RNA complex called the spliceosome. MIT biologists have now discovered a new layer of regulation that helps to determine which sites on the messenger RNA molecule the spliceosome will target. The research team discovered that this type of regulation, which appears to influence the expression of about half of all human genes, is found throughout the animal kingdom, as well as in plants. The findings suggest that the control of RNA splicing, a process that is fundamental to gene expression, is more complex than previously known. \"Splicing in more complex organisms, like humans, is more complicated than it is in some model organisms like yeast, even though it's a very conserved molecular process. There are bells and whistles on the human spliceosome that allow it to process specific introns more efficiently. One of the advantages of a system like this may be that it allows more complex types of gene regulation,\" says Connor Kenny, an MIT graduate student and the lead author of the study. Christopher Burge, the Uncas and Helen Whitaker Professor of Biology at MIT, is the senior author of the study, which appears in Nature Communications. RNA splicing, a process discovered in the late 1970s, allows cells to precisely control the content of the mRNA transcripts that carry the instructions for building proteins. Each mRNA transcript contains coding regions, known as exons, and noncoding regions, known as introns. They also include sites that act as signals for where splicing should occur, allowing the cell to assemble the correct sequence for a desired protein. This process enables a single gene to produce multiple proteins; over evolutionary timescales, splicing can also change the size and content of genes and proteins, when different exons become included or excluded. The spliceosome, which forms on introns, is composed of proteins and noncoding RNAs called small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). In the first step of spliceosome assembly, an snRNA molecule known as U1 snRNA binds to the 5' splice site at the beginning of the intron. Until now, it had been thought that the binding strength between the 5' splice site and the U1 snRNA was the most important determinant of whether an intron would be spliced out of the mRNA transcript. In the new study, the MIT team discovered that a family of proteins called LUC7 also helps to determine whether splicing will occur, but only for a subset of introns—in human cells, up to 50%. Before this study, it was known that LUC7 proteins associate with U1 snRNA, but the exact function wasn't clear. There are three different LUC7 proteins in human cells, and Kenny's experiments revealed that two of these proteins interact specifically with one type of 5' splice site, which the researchers called \"right-handed.\" A third human LUC7 protein interacts with a different type, which the researchers call \"left-handed.\" The researchers found that about half of human introns contain a right- or left-handed site, while the other half do not appear to be controlled by interaction with LUC7 proteins. This type of control appears to add another layer of regulation that helps remove specific introns more efficiently, the researchers say. \"The paper shows that these two different 5' splice site subclasses exist and can be regulated independently of one another,\" Kenny says. \"Some of these core splicing processes are actually more complex than we previously appreciated, which warrants more careful examination of what we believe to be true about these highly conserved molecular processes.\" Previous work has shown that mutation or deletion of one of the LUC7 proteins that bind to right-handed splice sites is linked to blood cancers, including about 10% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). In this study, the researchers found that AMLs that lost a copy of the LUC7L2 gene have inefficient splicing of right-handed splice sites. These cancers also developed the same type of altered metabolism seen in earlier work. \"Understanding how the loss of this LUC7 protein in some AMLs alters splicing could help in the design of therapies that exploit these splicing differences to treat AML,\" Burge says. \"There are also small molecule drugs for other diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy that stabilize the interaction between U1 snRNA and specific 5' splice sites. So the knowledge that particular LUC7 proteins influence these interactions at specific splice sites could aid in improving the specificity of this class of small molecules.\" Working with a lab led by Sascha Laubinger, a professor at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, the researchers found that introns in plants also have right- and left-handed 5' splice sites that are regulated by Luc7 proteins. The researchers' analysis suggests that this type of splicing arose in a common ancestor of plants, animals, and fungi, but it was lost from fungi soon after they diverged from plants and animals. \"A lot of what we know about how splicing works and what the core components are actually comes from relatively old yeast genetics work,\" Kenny says. \"What we see is that humans and plants tend to have more complex splicing machinery, with additional components that can regulate different introns independently.\" The researchers now plan to further analyze the structures formed by the interactions of Luc7 proteins with mRNA and the rest of the spliceosome, which could help them figure out in more detail how different forms of Luc7 bind to different 5' splice sites.

        "content": "by German Cancer Research Center Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain Acid reducing medicines from the group of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are best-selling drugs that prevent and alleviate stomach problems. PPIs are activated in the acid-producing cells of the stomach, where they block acid production. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) made the surprising discovery that zinc-carrying proteins, which are found in all cells, can also activate PPIs—without the presence of gastric acid. The result could be a key to understanding the side effects of PPIs. The study is published in Nature Chemistry. Excessive gastric acid can cause not only heartburn, but also chronic complaints such as gastritis or even a stomach ulcer. Doctors usually prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for treatment. Examples include the medications pantoprazole, omeprazole and rabeprazole. PPIs bind to and block an enzyme in the gastric parietal cells known as the proton pump, effectively reducing the production of gastric acid. PPIs are prodrugs, which means that they are taken as inactive precursors. Their activation to the actual active substance is triggered by protons. The presence of many protons is the hallmark of an acid. The proton pump in the intestinal wall supplies the protons for acidifying the gastric fluid. Since there is a particularly high concentration of protons in the immediate vicinity of the proton pump, the PPIs are activated locally. Proton-dependent activation ensures that PPIs almost exclusively attack and paralyze the proton pump, at least according to the current doctrine. Even though short-term use of PPIs is usually very well tolerated and considered harmless, long-term use poses health risks. Studies have suggested the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, dementia and susceptibility to infections. This raises the question of whether PPIs are also activated outside the stomach and influence other proteins, i.e. independently of an environment with a high proton concentration. A team of researchers led by biochemist Tobias Dick and chemist Aubry Miller, both at the DKFZ, have been looking into this question. They used a method known as click chemistry, a strategy for labeling molecules that was awarded the Nobel Prize three years ago. They used it to track rabeprazole, a typical representative of PPIs, in human cells in the culture dish, far from an acidic environment. In the process, the team made a surprising observation: the PPI was activated in the pH-neutral interior of the cells and bound to dozens of proteins there. Further analysis showed that these were zinc-binding proteins. \"This led us to hypothesize that protein-bound zinc can lead to the activation of PPIs, independently of the presence of protons,\" explains biologist Teresa Marker, first author of the publication. In the course of further investigations, the researchers were able to show that protein-bound zinc does in fact form a chemical bond with the PPI, which then leads to the activation of the PPI. The activated PPI is highly reactive and combines on the spot with the zinc-carrying protein. This in turn disrupts the structure and function of the attacked protein. \"From a chemical point of view, this result makes sense, because zinc can mimic the effect of protons and behave like an acid,\" explains chemist Aubry Miller of the DKFZ. Among the zinc-carrying proteins that were most affected by the PPI, some play a role in the immune system. However, further studies are needed to determine whether the newly discovered activation mechanism is associated with the known or suspected side effects of PPIs. \"These results open up new perspectives for a better understanding of the side effects of PPIs,\" summarizes Tobias Dick.

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-Imagn Images via Imago Jan 12, 2025; Dallas, Texas, USA; Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (15) runs back up the court during the second quarter against the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-Imagn Images Nikola Jokic is a lot of things. A baller, a hippophile (someone who loves horses), and someone with a humorous personality. Above all of them, however, Jokic is a family man. Besides his wife and two children, he is also very close to his two older brothers. Therefore, it made sense for them to be there as the Serbian star celebrated an important milestone. However, judging from the discussion about him, one brother looked like he stole the thunder from the Denver Nuggets star. Monica Geller could certainly relate! Fans captured Strahinja attending the All-Star game as the recent weekend marked his younger brother participating for the 7 time in the annual event. The behind-the-scenes footage featured Strahinja walking around, posing alongside Nikola and his family, and escorting both his wife and Nikola’s wife, Natalija. Throughout the clip, one couldn’t help but be amazed at the 43-year-old’s size. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad According to an April 2023 Sports Brief article, Strahinja is at least 7-foot tall. This makes his stature similar to that of Nikola Jokic. However, not many reports account for his overall build, which one can use to almost compare him to ‘The Mountain’ from Game of Thrones. Truly a force of nature! Strahinja’s recent appearance indicates he seems to have put in some major work from the last time we saw him during an NBA event in April 2024. It looks like he’s training for a part in the next Rocky movie! However, there’s a legal battle hovering around for the duo. A post shared by Bleacher Report (@bleacherreport) Both Strahinja and Natalija had gotten into trouble at that time after reportedly fighting with an NBA fan during a game in Denver. Strahinja even punched the man in full view of everyone. Before long, he received a third-degree assault charge. This marked the 2nd time in 5 years that his physical actions got Strahinja placed under the purview of the law. Back in January, the court set an official trial date to take the case forward after Strahinja pleaded not guilty. Set to take place in Los Angeles, we await the legal procedures and the case’s final judgment. Is Strahinja Jokic the real MVP of the Jokic family with his towering presence and charisma? Debate Fortunately, the former European basketball player seemed unfazed during his recent appearance. This gave the NBA community a chance to talk less about Strahinja’s past, and more about his current build. One social media user went straight to a DC reference by stating “Bane and Joker in the same family”. Most of us know the whereabouts of Nikola Jokic called ‘The Joker’. However, it is not because he walks around in psychotic face makeup saying, “Why so serious?” Mike Miller gave him the nickname because he had trouble pronouncing his last name. However, now that the name is stuck as part of his legacy, it is nice for Nikola to have a ‘Bane’ at his side, too. One individual attributed the size to the heritage by commenting “Average Balkan citizen”. Well, there is no denying the genes would have certainly contributed to the European player’s huge size. After all, even the shortest brother in the family, Nemanja, stands at 6 feet, 6 inches. According to a report by the Abilene Reporter-News, people residing in certain areas of the Balkans, especially in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro are on average the tallest, averaging 6’ 1” in height. If anyone still does not believe it, all they need to do is stand beside the 3 Jokic brothers. The official account of Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson’s ‘All The Smoke’ podcast also put one comment out. It stated, “I promise anyone yall don’t want smoke with big bro (crying emojis)”. People don’t need a reminder of this. Just the former player’s physical physique is enough to intimidate anyone. Furthermore, the person Strahinja allegedly got into an altercation with last year realizes this fact too. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nikola Jokic’s brother, Strahinja Jokic, is fighting back in his assault case ... pic.twitter.com/Fiw1ShlEPu — TMZ (@TMZ) January 7, 2025 Expand Tweet One individual suggested Strahinja can find his footing in a new sport by writing “WWE needs to sign him”. The Serbian can certainly prove to be a tough opponent to several big names in the wrestling world. With ‘The Rock’ back in WWE now, a rival pairing between the two can make for some entertaining viewing. Personally, he looks like Braun Strowman’s twin. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Feel like the Bane reference was enough? Well, the superhero/supervillain references were not over, as one social media user wrote “Joker and Juggernaut”. Bane, Juggernaut, The Mountain. Let’s just agree. Yes, the guy is huge. When going through a list of fictional characters he can be related to, the list would probably be longer than the filing cabinet in ‘Bruce Almighty’. Overall, the majority of reactions displayed their appreciation for Nikola Jokic’s elder brother. The worry of the upcoming trial would certainly be on Strahinja’s mind. Therefore, it is nice to know he received some positive attention during his brother’s big event. Let the world know your perspective.

        "content": "In a heartwarming episode of Shark Tank India 4, HireForCare, a platform dedicated to addressing the unique needs of children with neurological disabilities, secured an all-shark deal. Founders Rajat Vij and Ram Niwas, both deeply connected to the cause, left a lasting impression with their dedication and vision. Rajat, a single parent of a child with cerebral palsy, and Ram, who tragically lost his wife in a car accident just 20 days before the shoot, turned their personal challenges into a mission to support families like theirs. Launched in March 2021, HireForCare specializes in cerebral palsy and autism, offering much-needed services to families raising children with special needs. Their goal is simple yet profound, to empower every child to reach their full potential and lead a happy, fulfilling life. Rajat Vij said, “We’re not just building a business; we’re creating a community. HireForCare is dedicated for the unique needs of children with Neurological Disabilities & to build a one stop special child care solution. This partnership is more than an investment—it’s a shared mission. With the sharks’ guidance, we are poised to scale our efforts and drive meaningful change in the lives of special needs children and their families.” Not only were the sharks moved by their story, they also saw immense value and purpose behind HireForCare. Anupam Mittal emphasized the uniqueness of their mission and advised them to build a broader ecosystem for special needs childcare. In a historic moment for Shark Tank India, the sharks proposed a “friends and family” round, where they would not only invest but also help HireForCare define its strategic direction. The all-shark deal by Anupam Mittal, Aman Gupta, Vineeta Singh, Kunal Bahl, and Peyush Bansal, was sealed at 36 Lakh for 5% Equity, marking a monumental step forward for HireForCare. As Rajat and Ram joined the Shark Tank India family, they gained not just financial backing but also the mentorship and support of some of India’s sharpest business minds. With this collaboration, HireForCare is set to transform the landscape of special needs caregiving in India, ensuring that every child receives the care and support they deserve.

The woman entered the lift with her pet dog, where a child was already present and expressed fear of the animal. Apurwa Amit Updated : Feb 20, 2025, 03:32 PM IST A woman has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a minor boy who asked her not to bring her pet dog into the lift of a residential building in Greater Noida West, Uttar Pradesh, police officials told CNN-News18. The incident took place around 5 PM on Wednesday at 12th Avenue in Gaur City 2. The woman entered the lift with her pet dog, where a child was already present and expressed fear of the animal. “On February 19, a video of a woman dragging a boy out of a lift at the 12th Avenue of Gaur City 2 Society of Greater Noida West has gone viral on social media. The police took cognisance of the video and registered a case. The woman has been detained. Further legal proceedings in the case are underway,\" DCP Central Noida Shakti Awasthi said, as quoted by CNN-News18. February 19, 2025 CCTV footage from inside the lift reportedly shows that the minor was frightened and pleaded with the woman, asking her with folded hands not to bring her pet dog inside. Instead of complying, the woman allegedly told the boy to exit the lift and pressed the button for her desired floor. The footage also captured the woman shoving the young boy and pulling him out of the lift. She then positioned herself behind him, allegedly intending to physically harm him without being visible on camera, according to the report. The incident has sparked outrage among netizens, raising concerns about why the woman was permitted to allow her dog to roam freely in the residential society without a leash or muzzle.

        "content": "Axar Patel was not inches milimtres away from becoming the first-ever Indian to take a hat-trick in an ICC Champions Trophy match. However, Rohit Sharma’s massive error kept Axar’s dream away from him against Bangladesh in Dubai. The moment came in the ninth over when Axar was on fire, having dismissed Tanzid Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim in consecutive deliveries. With history on the line, Axar Patel delivered a sharp delivery to Jaker Ali. It was another flighted delivery, drawing an outside edge that went straight to Rohit Sharma, who was stationed at first slip. The Indian skipper didn’t have to move much to reach to the ball and even got his hands to it. However, the ball travelled at a slower rate than he anticipated and dropped a catch that carried the weight of Axar’s emotions. But Rohit dropped a dolly. He immediately realized the gravity of his mistake, slamming his hand on the turf in frustration. Axar, who had already turned away in celebration, was left in disbelief as the chance went begging. The bowler could only watch as Jaker survived what should have been a moment of history. Watch the drop catch below. Rohit Sharma, what have you done? That was the hat-trick ball 😭 pic.twitter.com/nabU58MhWJ Apparently, the ICC Champion Trophy has seen just one hat-trick so far that came for the West Indies when pacer Jerome Taylor bagged the feat against Australia in 2006.

(Sponsored) In the last couple of years, smart home devices have come a long way in elevating our day to day convenience by way of integrated systems and automations, not to mention the burgeoning industry of accessible and easy to assemble home security products. In 2025 however, the Aqara Camera Hub G5 Pro is about to raise the bar and then some. If you make a purchase on or before 22 February, you can enjoy 15% off with the code UKG5TR20. Aqara is already well known as one of the leading companies in the smart home space, having been in operation for more than a decade and a half. In that time it has put out a wide range of smart home products including smart panels, door locks, security cameras, smart sensors and more. For the G5 Pro outdoor security camera, Aqara has used its accumulated skills and talent to create something truly special. On the surface, the Aqara G5 Pro is a robust security camera designed to keep you and your loved ones safe by offering a detailed look at anything of importance happening around your home. The crisp 4MP resolution pairs brilliantly with a wide 133 degree field of view to provide a detailed look at the camera’s surroundings, while the f/1.0 aperture is able to capture four times as much light as traditional f/2.0 lenses, preventing any dimly lit areas from being missed in recorded footage. When the sun does go down however, the True Color Night Vision kicks in to keep the level of clarity between day and night-time consistent. There’s no chance of someone or something using the cover of night to approach your home undetected – you’ll be notified as soon as they come into the camera’s line of sight. These are great features to have but what really separates the Aqara G5 Pro from the competition is its use of AI to more accurately identify what it’s seeing. Courtesy of the built-in NPU, the Aqara G5 Pro can differentiate between people and vehicles while recognising when any pets or packages are around, so you’ll know right away if further action is required. If the internet signal in your house ever goes offline, you won’t have to worry about these AI features being inaccessible either, as their operation takes place entirely on the G5 Pro camera itself and without the need for cloud-based processing. Any recording can even be locally stored thanks to built-in eMMC storage that can be backed up to your NAS and retrieved afterward. When your internet connection is working smoothly though, you can access your recordings from wherever you are thanks to cloud-based storage. Buy the Aqara G5 Pro PoE edition Speaking of internet connections, the Aqara G5 Pro comes in two unique versions, a PoE model for a strong, direct connection via an Ethernet cable, and a Wi-Fi model that allows for more versatility in terms of placement. Whichever one you go for, you can rely on a sturdy connection and a robust, waterproof build that makes the camera prepped and ready to take on the elements. Buy the Aqara G5 Pro WiFi edition As you may have guessed from its full name, the Aqara Camera Hub G5 Pro also works as a smart home hub compatible with Thread, Zigbee and Bluetooth, allowing you to expand your smart home controls into your home’s exterior or back garden. This means that if you have been meaning to add smart home products around your home, such as sensors and smart lights, then the G5 Pro is the perfect place to start to make sure that everything is interconnected. More importantly, as a Matter Controller, the G5 Pro can connect and manage Aqara products but also Matter-enabled devices from other brands. You can even pair up the Aqara G5 Pro with your smart platform of choice. For instance, you can dive straight into controls for the Aqara G5 Pro via Apple Home on your iPhone, or ask Alexa to show you the camera’s livestream on your nearest Echo Show device. Alexa, Apple, Google, SmartThings – whichever system you prefer, the Aqara G5 Pro is ready to oblige. The G5 Pro also supports the RTSP protocol, which means that it not only streams to third-party clients like Home Assistant via a LAN, but also is compatible with RTSP-enabled video servers.And as a final cherry on top, there’s now full end-to-end encryption on the footage stored in Aqara’s own cloud-based servers, offering an extra layer of protection on what is already one of the most feature packed home security devices you can buy. To see the Aqara G5 Pro’s full list of included features, and how it can revamp the security of your home like no other device, you can pick up your own model today on both Amazon and Aqara’s official website.

        "content": "Home » Korean Entertainment News South Korean actress Park Bo-Young’s recent drama Melo Movie has some scenes that sparked controversies among the viewers. Read on to know more. In the newly released Netflix series Melo Movie, Park Bo-Young plays Kim Moo-Bi, an aspiring assistant director who transitioned into a director’s role. While the actress has returned to the rom-com era after a long time, she has shown a different side of herself while portraying Moo-Bi. One of the most talked-about scenes that has garnered much attention from the audience is where she can be seen smoking cigarettes. Before this drama, Bo-Young has always played a good girl’s character, portraying her pure image. However, this time, her character’s arc has made her fans go crazy as they have seen her smoking on-screen. Recently, she opened up about her smoking scenes. Scroll ahead to read about what she said and how the netizens have been reacting. In an interview with a Korean media outlet, Sports Chosun, Park Bo-Young talked about her scenes where she can be seen smoking cigarettes. Explaining how she prepared herself for such scenes, she said, “There were too many people involved when filming that scene. I received the most direction for it. They kept correcting my fingers and telling me my positioning was wrong. Even the smoking staff members on set gave me advice. When we finally filmed the last take, I could feel that it was coming out naturally.” However, these scenes sparked mixed reactions from the netizens. While a lot of people appreciated her hard work to perfect such gestures, others slammed her for not doing it right. Praising Park Bo-Young, one wrote, “It has a certain vibe,” another commented, “She pulled it off well.” On the other hand, one of the netizens criticized her by saying, “Her hand movements look unnatural.” Another viewer wrote it to be a “typical fake smoking scene.” In the same interview, the Daily Dose of Sunshine actress shared why she chose to do Melo Movie and explained her experience working on the series. She said, “At first, I asked, ‘Is this the right fit for me?’ But I had always wanted to try a role like this. If my previous roles were bright and lovable, I now wanted to showcase a different side of myself. It’s not just about sweet, romantic moments; the characters acknowledge each other’s pain, help heal one another, and ultimately grow. Living as Moo-bi gave me a different kind of happiness, and it was a truly meaningful time for me.” This is the first time that Park Bo-Young has been paired with Choi Woo-Shik, and viewers have been appreciating their chemistry, showering love on the on-screen couple. Melo Movie premiered on February 14, 2025, on Netflix, and since then, the series has been making headlines every now and then.

        "content": "Home Pakistan CM Maryam approves mega sewage, drainage system plan in Punjab LAHORE – Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Thursday approved a new mega sewage and drainage system plan for the whole province. All major cities of Punjab would get a new sewage and drainage system. The Punjab CM sought a plan for 189 cities with populations of over 100,000, under which sewage, water drainage, rainwater disposal, street paving and other development works would be carried out. For the first time, a decision was made to build sewage bypasses and disposal stations in cities. The storage tanks would be built for the immediate disposal of rainwater, and the stored water would be used for irrigation and other purposes. An agreement was made to lay sewage and water supply pipelines at appropriate distances in cities. The clean water would be laid parallel to sewage lines at proper distances to prevent contamination. In each provincial constituency, 30 kilometers of roads would be constructed and rehabilitated. The proposal for building model villages in Punjab was reviewed in the meeting, and the Chief Minister approved it. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed immediate steps for the implementation of the Punjab Development Program. In a special meeting chaired by the Chief Minister, ongoing projects of the PICP were reviewed, and discussions were held on the project under WATSAN. CM Maryam said that the “Clean Punjab Program” would benefit 150 million people of the province. Due to the lack of an efficient sewage system, every city faces problems. Creating a sustainable and safe sewage system would protect roads from wear and tear. © 2025 All rights reserved | Pakistan Observer © 2024 All rights reserved | Pakistan Observer"

        "content": "20:53 GMT 19 Feb 2025, updated 10:13 GMT 20 Feb 2025 By KATE DENNETT FOR MAILONLINE EastEnders fans rejoiced on Wednesday night when antagonist Reiss Colwell was brutally killed off after the Queen Vic exploded. The blaze began after Cindy Beale pushed her husband Ian into the path of a car being driven by Reiss, who swerved and crashed into the Queen Vic. However, the vehicle collided straight into gas canisters and many Walford legends were trapped inside amid the chaos, with their fates uncertain. And Wednesday's episode claimed its first victim as Reiss perished in the deadly fire in a shocking twist. He returned to the Queen Vic to see Sonia when Bianca pushed him in the path of a bathtub, which fell from the ceiling, seemingly killing the soap villain. Before he was killed, he visited Sonia while she was in labour while trapped inside the kitchen with Lauren Branning and Bianca Jackson, and said: 'It sounds like congratulations are in order.' Sonia shouted: 'You are a freak, Reiss. You are a murdering freak. You're not going to be any part of my daughter's life. 'You don't mean that, it's the hormones talking. We're meant to be together and the sooner you realise that- blood is thicker than water and that baby will always be my blood', Reiss said. Pushing him backwards, Bianca screamed: 'Why don't you just drop dead!' Unharmed, Reiss said: 'Well, that was close.' However, Reiss spoke too soon as a massive bath tub then came crashing on top of him. After Bianca confirmed he was dead, Sonia said: 'Good.' Fans shared their joy, with some admitting it was 'comedy gold' that he got killed by a bath tub. Some wrote on X: 'This has made me so happy. Reiss Colwell after depriving Bianca of a bath for months you were killed by a bath. May Debbie continue to smile whilst sleeping', 'Reiss Colwell just got crushed like a bug in #EastEnders good riddance', 'The bath falling on Reiss was comedy gold and then Sonia saying good after Bianca said he was dead', 'Ahahahahaha Reiss got squished by a bathtub', 'Good riddance to Reiss'. Earlier in the episode, Anita Dobson left EastEnders fans gobsmacked as she made a surprise return as the iconic Angie Watts for the soap's special anniversary episode. The actress, 75, played the Queen Vic's first landlady from the show's very first episode in 1985 before bowing out three-years later. And to celebrate the soap's 40th year anniversary, she made a brief cameo in the hour-long special with a heart-wrenching scene with her onscreen daughter Sharon. Sharon - played by actress Letitia Dean - saw a vision of her mother Angie visiting her and begging her to scream for help, where she lay trapped under a broken staircase. The emotional scene saw Angie looking like she hadn't aged a day, as she sported her famous brown curls and red lipstick. She told her injured daughter: 'You're not giving up on us are you Sharon? Hello darling. I've missed you so much. 'I wish I could just put my arms around you and give you a great big hug. But it's not time for us to be together yet darling.' Sharon admitted she was scared and her mother replied: 'We're all scared aren't we? I mean look at me, spent my whole life being scared. But you've got to keep fighting Sharon.' A weak Sharon confessed: 'I need you' causing Angie to become teary-eyed as she said: 'Me? No, you don't need me, because I've been watching over you and let me tell you, you are doing just fine on your own.' She then pleaded with her daughter: 'But you've got to be strong for me now Sharon, do you understand me? You've got a lot of life yet to live. Don't throw it away. Don't waste it like I did. 'So don't give up, do you hear me? You mustn't give up, because we don't give up do we? We are fighters Sharon. So come on my darling use that voice and you start screaming for help.' As Sharon began to call out for help, Angie smiled through her tears and cried: 'Go on Sharon go on! Louder! That’s it baby, keep screaming. Yes, that’s my girl' before fading from view. And viewers watching at home were left 'screaming' at the shock cameo, taking to X to admit they were 'shook to the core' and had 'goosebumps' at seeing Angie again, branding it the 'tv moment of the year'. They wrote: 'i can’t believe we had an anita dobson cameo in 2025, i am truly shook to the core... best thing i’ve ever seen'; 'ANGIE WATTS OH MY GOOD LORD'. 'The nation screamed'; 'Chris Clenshaw really did say “let’s make it legendary”. WHAT A PLOT TWIST TO SEE ANGIE WATTS.' 'OMG! Angie!!!!! Dreams really do come true! I’m so damn happy she’s back for their 40th to the day episode!'; 'She hasn't aged a day and still a powerhouse of an actress'. 'What a genius way of bringing back Angie Watts!! The wonderful Anita Dobson!'; 'Amazing cameo that totally made sense for the moment. Bravo.' ''ANGIE WATTS, I PRAYED AND I WON'; 'I bet they thought all their Christmases had come at once when Anita Dobson agreed to come back and do that cameo!'; 'That Sharon and ghost Angie scene was perfect'. 'Angie Watts back from the dead! I am shaking'; 'I love how Angie hasn’t aged a day with that iconic wig plonked back on her head. I love Ghostenders!' 'Angie Watts showing up is not what I expected from tonight but what a gift they gave us'; 'ANGIE WATTS??? HELL YEAH WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE OH MY GOD THE GRIN I GRUN'. 'i can’t believe we got her back, even if only for a moment. and wearing her first-ever dressed-up outfit too. after all this time, angie watts came home!!!'; 'I’ve got tears the ghost of Angie Watts returns to tell Sharon to keep fighting!' 'Angie Watts on the #EastEnders end credits for the first time since 1989 - and among some 90's legends. What an actual goosebump-inducing moment.'; '#eastenders tv moment of the year'. Speaking about her return to Walford after all these years, EastEnders boss Chris Clenshaw said: 'Angie Watts is undoubtedly one of EastEnders most formidable and iconic landlady’s. 'Since the very first episode, Anita instantly created a character that the audience adored and she not only shaped EastEnders into the show it is today, but also had a huge impact on British television. 'Anita was of course top of our ultimate wish list when we were discussing what we would love to include in our special anniversary week, so it was the best birthday present we could ever receive when she said yes. 'Watching Angie Watts grace the halls of The Queen Victoria, 40 years to the day she made her first appearance in Walford, is a day we will never forget as we all celebrate this show that has played such an important part in British television. Happy birthday EastEnders.' While Anita admitted she had worked very hard to keep her return a secret, only spilling the beans to her Queen rocker husband Brian May. She said: 'I obviously told Brian, but I honestly haven’t told anybody! It’s been really hard because so many people that I’m really close to have said \"oh are you going back?\" because I’ve gone back to do the documentary, so it’s been so hard not to say anything. 'But, I’ve been a really good girl and I’ve kept my little mouth shut because I didn’t want there to be any spoilers!' While she gushed about reuniting on screen with Letitia, comparing it to 'stepping back into warm water' and admitted it was that which convinced her to return. She said: 'It was absolutely lovely. That’s what clinched it for me. When they initially asked if I would come back when I was filming for the documentary, I wasn’t really thinking of the whole picture at first, and then when they said Letitia had said that she’d like me to do it with her, I thought \"oh my god, I can’t say no to seeing my baby again.\" 'It was very emotional. Incredibly emotional in a lovely, happy way. Working together again was seamless. 'We didn’t really think about it, or talk about it, or even rehearse it that much because we just did it. It was lovely. She’s a gorgeous human being and a lovely little actress.'"

In a video message, All Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association Chairman Abdul Sami Khan said that they rejected the de-regulated formula for petroleum product prices. He warned that the imposition of the de-regulated formula would lead to an increase in petroleum smuggling and adulteration. He explained that de-regulating the prices of petroleum products would allow petrol pumps to set their own prices. An emergency meeting of the central committee was called, and protest banners would be displayed across the country on Thursday. Abdul Sami Khan further mentioned that an urgent letter would be sent to the Ministry of Petroleum, opposing the de-regulation formula and demanding an increase in the margin. The margin for petroleum dealers per liter should be raised by 4%, making it 13 rupees. OGRA supported the de-regulation formula but the ministry lacked the courage to speak out. The Petroleum Dealers Association chairman also pointed out that smuggling of petroleum products from Iran had started increasing again. He called for the federal government to make a legal agreement with Iran to curb smuggling. He claimed that the de-regulation would not lead to cheaper petrol for the public and that Petroleum Minister Musaddik Malik had ignored petroleum dealers. © 2025 All rights reserved | Pakistan Observer © 2024 All rights reserved | Pakistan Observer"

Ademola Lookman was the hero of that match, scoring a brilliant hat-trick in Dublin as La Dea ran out 3-0 winners. His performance helped to earn him a nomination for the 2024 Ballon d'Or. Gian Piero Gasperini's side continued to chart impressive progress in this season's UEFA Champions League, narrowly missing out on automatic passage to the Round of 16 as they finished ninth in the inaugural league phase. However, all of the progress and feelgood factor of an incredible era for the Bergamo club came crashing down when they lost 5-2 on aggregate to Club Brugge in the knockout playoff. Nursing a 2-1 deficit from the first leg, Atalanta fell 3-0 behind on the night in front of their own fans. Lookman was only fit enough for a place on the bench, came on at halftime and reduced the arrears. The Nigeria winger then had a penalty saved as Atalanta's faint hopes dissipated. What followed was a remarkable spat between player and coach, which continues to play out in public. MORE: Teams out of UEFA Champions League 2024/25: Which clubs have been eliminated?

Atalanta captain Rafael Toloi was sent off late on as he tried to chase down and hit Maxim De Cuyper, an act of incredible head loss. The incident was described as \"ugly\" by his coach. And yet it was Lookman who found himself most notably in Gasperini's crosshairs afterwards, with the veteran tactician furious and unsparing over the former RB Leipzig player's decision to take the penalty when, well, he's not very good at them. \"Lookman was not supposed to take that penalty. He is one of the worst penalty takers I've ever seen,\" Gasperini said. Had Lookman scored, Atalanta would have reduced the score on the night to 3-2 with around half an hour left to play. \"He has a frankly terrible record even in training; he converts very few of them. [Mateo] Retegui and [Charles] De Ketelaere were there, but Lookman in a moment of enthusiasm after scoring decided to take the ball and that was a gesture I did not appreciate at all.\" Lookman published a statement on social media on Thursday in response to his coach's remarkable diatribe. \"It saddens me on a day like this to have to write this statement — most of all because of what we have achieved together as a team and as a city,\" the forward wrote. \"Being singled out in the manner I have been not only hurts, but feels deeply disrespectful, not least because of the immense hard work and commitment I have always put in each and every day to help bring success to this club and to the incredible fans of Bergamo. \"In truth, I have dealt with many difficult moments during my time here, the majority of which I have never spoken about because in my opinion the team must always be protected and must come first. This makes what happened last night even more hurtful. \"Along with our incredible fans, we as a team are hurting too with last night's result. During the match the designated penalty taker instructed me to take the penalty; and to support the team I took responsibility in the moment to do so. \"Life's about challenges and turning pain into power which I'll continue to do.\" Former Italy star Alessandro Del Piero said during a television broadcast on Sky Sport Italia that Lookman was justified in his response, saying he \"would have been very upset\" had he been in the same position.

        "content": "By Dakin Andone and Alexandra Skores, CNN (CNN) — After Delta Flight 4819’s cabin rolled over and came to rest in a terrifying crash landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport, a flight attendant stood on what had been the ceiling – one leg propped on an upturned baggage compartment – and addressed passengers who’d unbuckled themselves from upside-down seats. “Drop everything! Drop it. Come on,” she shouts in a video recorded by a passenger, her voice composed but forceful as she guides people to leave through an open exit door. “Put that phone away!” As authorities investigate the cause of Monday’s crash, broad consensus about part of the aftermath has emerged: The pair of flight attendants did well to help dozens of passengers evacuate from the overturned aircraft. “They performed their work perfectly as aviation’s first responders,” said Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, using one of the union’s favorite descriptors for its more than 50,000 members. “This is the reason that we are on the plane: to evacuate passengers from a crash landing like this safely,” she said. “And they did that.” Though flight attendants help keep passengers comfortable in part by giving out drinks, snacks, blankets and headphones, attendants are first meant to help keep travelers safe – a job that requires extensive and repeated training. “They are responsible for much more than picking up trash and serving sodas,” said Michael McCormick, an associate professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “They’re trained professionals responsible for the safety of the passengers. And they did a phenomenal job.” All 80 people on board Monday’s flight – four crew and 76 passengers – survived the crash, though officials said 21 people were taken to hospitals with injuries. By Wednesday, all but one had been released, Delta said. The flight, operated by Delta’s regional partner Endeavor Air, took off from Minneapolis bound for the Toronto area, which strong winds had been hitting all day. Shortly after 2 p.m., as the flight approached Toronto Pearson – located in the suburb of Mississauga – air traffic controllers warned the pilots about 38 mph gusts. The aircraft landed hard on the runway, video shows, the right wing making contact with the ground before falling away in a blaze of fire. The aircraft, a CRJ-900, then rolled over as it skidded along the landing strip. When it came to a rest, the passengers were hanging upside down, strapped in their seats as firefighters rushed to the scene to extinguish the flames. The two flight attendants have not been publicly identified, and they have not spoken out amid the ongoing investigation. But footage captured by passenger Pete Koukov provides a brief glimpse of their actions, and how they aligned with their training. That training, according to Nelson, the union president, is tailored by aircraft type and covers varied scenarios, including evacuations by both land and water. “This is one of the scenarios that we talk about: landing and finding yourselves actually upside down,” she said. Video shows attendant directing passengers Flight attendants are trained to respond this way in the first moments after a crash: quickly locate the emergency exit, and ask passengers to remain in their seats or stand back as the attendants determine the scene is safe, Nelson told CNN. Then, they would instruct passengers to release their seat belts and come to an exit – whether an emergency door or, in a more extreme crash, a hole in the side of the plane. As passengers evacuate, the attendants would ask the first two able-bodied people to remain just outside to help other passengers, Nelson said. Passengers would be instructed to leave behind their luggage, because it could impede the evacuation or slow their ability to get away from the aircraft, Nelson said. “The biggest risk in that moment is fire engulfing the cabin before everyone can get off,” she said, noting flight attendants are trained for that reason to evacuate passengers in as few as 90 seconds. Indeed, Koukov’s video appears to show pieces of this training unfolding during Monday’s evacuation: The flight attendant stands just inside the emergency exit, shouting commands to the passengers – including directing them to leave behind their belongings. As she pushes passengers through the exit, they are met by two men standing on either side of the emergency exit, who help lift evacuees onto the tarmac. This training becomes second nature, according to Nelson, allowing flight attendants to respond automatically in a situation that might leave anyone else in a state of shock. “That’s why we go through training,” she said. “Almost every single debrief that I have ever heard from any kind of critical incident, the flight attendants say, ‘It was incredible. That training kicked in, and I just moved to action.’” Flight attendant training programs vary slightly by airline. Delta, for example, requires seven weeks of instruction in Atlanta following the hiring process and a conditional job offer, according to its website. Federal regulations require a variety of emergency training scenarios, from evacuations and firefighting to rapid decompression of the cabin and hijackings. They also require crew members to undergo recurrent training every 24 months. “Air travel remains the safest form of transportation,” Deborah Flint, CEO of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, said at a news conference Tuesday, echoing a mantra often cited by air travel experts, including in recent weeks amid a series of high-profile accidents, some of them deadly. Accidents for regularly scheduled commercial airlines are rare. But of those that happen, many are not catastrophic – including those involving turbulence or collisions between planes taxiing on the ground – leaving flight attendants in a position to utilize their training. Among regularly scheduled US carriers, 1,133 accidents happened from 1983 to 2017, according to a 2020 National Transportation Safety Board analysis, which defined accidents as incidents that caused at least one serious injury or substantial damage to the plane. Just 35 were considered serious, meaning they involved a fire, at least one serious injury or death, and a substantially damaged or destroyed aircraft. Regardless, the flight attendants are there, ready to help passengers and survivors. “Every time you board a flight, you are greeted by flight attendants and by flight crew,” Flint said. “Often, it’s their job to make us comfortable and confident about the flight ahead, and they do an incredible job with that. But we saw the most important role that they play in action yesterday.” “I thank each and every one of these heroes, every flight attendant and crew member on Delta Flight 4819,” she said. “I also thank every flight attendant and crew member across the industry.” CNN’s Holly Yan contributed to this report.

        "content": "Amid the row over YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia's comments at 'India's Got Latent' show, the government has issued an advisory to over-the-top platforms to follow legal norms and take appropriate action against violation of regulations. Complaints have been received from members of Parliament, statutory organisations and the public regarding alleged spread of obscene, pornographic and vulgar content published by certain publishers of online curated content and social media, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting said in an advisory dated Feb. 19. \"In view of the above, it is advised that the OTT platforms adhere to the various provisions of applicable laws, and the Code of Ethics prescribed under IT Rules, 2021 while publishing content on their platforms, including stricter adherence of the age based classification of content prescribed under the Code of Ethics. Further, self-regulatory bodies of OTT platforms are requested to take appropriate proactive action for violation of Code of Ethics by the platforms,\" it said. The advisory highlighted part three of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media, Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, that lays out a 'Code of Ethics' for OTT platforms, and a three level institutional mechanism for redressal of grievances relating to violations. The norms require OTT platforms not to transmit any content which is prohibited by law, undertake age-based classification of content, based on general guidelines provided in the rules, implementation of access control mechanism for ‘A’ rated content to restrict access to such content by a minor, and also exercise due caution and discretion. Further, the IT rules provide that the self-regulatory bodies of OTT platforms should oversee and ensure the alignment and adherence to these norms. The publication of obscene or pornographic content is also punishable offence as per various laws. The advisory comes after Ranveer Allahbadia's comments during comedian Samay Rana's India's Got Latent row sparked an uproar. Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahbadia for the comments, which compelled him to approach the Supreme Court for interim relief."

The play has been drawing packed houses, resonating with audiences across generations through its grand production, sharp humor, and stellar performances. At the center of this entertaining spectacle is Ali Asgar as Emperor Akbar, whose royal troubles go beyond governance—his biggest challenges are palace politics and the romantic dilemmas of his son, Shehzada Salim (Pawan Singh).

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus) via Imago Toronto Blue Jays’ Vladimir Guerrero Jr. reacts after hitting a solo home run against the Texas Rangers during the first inning of a baseball game in Buffalo, N.Y., Friday, July 16, 2021. (AP Photo/Adrian Kraus) One moment, you’re standing at your base, and the next moment, the ground under you starts to shake. That’s what happened with Triston Casas, the Red Sox’s first baseman. Days after Casas displayed support, trying to maintain Rafael Devers at 3B—his first base is under threat. A new name has entered the conversation—one that could change everything. And if Boston replies to the new guy’s interest, Casas’s loyalty to his teammates might not be enough to keep his spot. The Red Sox weren’t exactly looking for drama when they signed the superstar, Alex Bregman. They were merely looking to bag the best defensive third basemen in the league. But this addition shook up the Red Sox’s clubhouse and threatened Rafael Devers’ spot – the third base. Devers signed an 11-year, $331 million deal just last year. He did not expect his position to be under threat, obviously. Therefore, all hell broke loose. While Devers has built a strong offense for the Sox, Bregman’s game is way more advanced. If Boston was prioritizing defense, they could move Devers. But Devers made his stance clear, 3B is his position, and intends to concrete his base. That’s when fellow teammate, 1B, Triston Casas joined the debate. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “I think it’s Rafi D’s position. He’s the third baseman, and at that point, that’s where it stands,” Casas said showing his support. “He’s done it for a long time now. And he’s only gotten better at doing it,” he added. Siding with Devers when the Red Sox’s front office seems to be rethinking everything to switch things up may not have been the best idea. That’s when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. entered the conversation, shaking up the Red Sox’s infield discussion even more. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the first baseman has been the key player to the Toronto Blue Jays’ offense for years. However, Vlad Jr. may not spend his next season in Hogtown. Vlad Jr. has reportedly turned down two contract extension offers from the Blue Jays. The negotiations are currently stalling, but it’s possible Vlad Jr. may become a free agent after the 2025 season. It’s no secret that Vladimir Guerrero has told friends that if he hits free agency, he’d love to play for the Boston Red Sox. Free agency begins in 8 1/2 months as Guerrero officially enters spring without a contract extension. — Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) February 18, 2025 Expand Tweet The Red Sox ended the 2024 season with an even 81-81 record. Finishing the season in third place in the AL East. Not exactly a dominant score and certainly not the dominant play the Red Sox Nation is used to. Adding on, their audience may be slowly losing interest. Red Sox home attendance in 2024, averaged 32,838 fans per game. This is a continued decline from 35,748 in 2018 and 32,989 in 2023. With this and the Yankees and Rays overtaking, it’s clear that Boston needs to switch it up. Getting in new stars attracts fans, and, yes, they might have got one. Will Vladimir Guerrero Jr. joining the Red Sox spell the end for Triston Casas at first base? Debate This could be an opportunity for Boston with Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s separation from the Blue Jays and his interest in the Red Sox. However, it would put them in the same position as now. Triston Casas, their current first baseman, had a .263 average, 24 home runs, and .865 OPS in 2023, leaving him confident of his own position. While not as good as his 2023 season, he had a decent 2024 season, posting a .241 batting average, 13 home runs, 32 RBIs, and a .800 OPS. However, Vlad Jr., an All-Star player and a former AL MVP candidate, had a .323 batting average, 30 home runs, and 103 RBIs in the 2024 season. This sort of offensive talent from Vlad Jr. would be attractive to any team looking to switch up their game. But would the Red Sox take in Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as an upgrade over Casas? Casas has potential but Vlad Jr.’s track record shows a better performance. Still, taking him into the team would mean a replica of the ongoing 3B drama. If he comes in, would the All-Star first baseman be a designated hitter (DH), keeping Casas at first base? This would keep Casas, at first, while integrating Vlad Jr.’s offensive power into their lineup. But this solution also comes with challenges, it will mean shuffling existing DH options and altering payrolls. All in all, while the idea of acquiring Vlad Jr. is enticing, the Red Sox must consider the pros and cons of such a move. From the looks of it, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is getting ready to go the free agency route after the 2025 season. And teams are already lining up to bag The All-Star first baseman. So far the Red Sox are involved, especially with reports that the hard-hitting Dominican star would entertain Boston. via Getty TORONTO, ONTARIO – SEPTEMBER 18: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. #27 of the Toronto Blue Jays takes the field for warm ups prior to playing the Minnesota Twins during their MLB game at the Rogers Centre on September 18, 2021 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Mark Blinch/Getty Images) The Mets are also involved in the mix, After the record-breaking deal of $765 million with Juan Soto, we know the Mets got the money. But the Mets aren’t immune to twists—Pete Alonso’s future with the Mets isn’t solid either. Alonso signed a two-year deal with an opt-out, giving Mets, a chance to reconsider. It’s a possibility that Vlad Jr. could be their long-term solution. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Then there are the usual teams with the big bucks and hunger for talent—the Giants, Cubs, and Padres. But the Yankees may not be joining the bid. Let’s just say the star slugger isn’t exactly a fan of the pinstripes. Even though he softened his stance about them in 2024, he has made past comments about never wanting to join the Bombers. This makes his free agency race even more interesting. With the 2025 season approaching, the anticipation around Vlad Jr.’s next move will only get deeper. Which team will he end up with? And which ones will miss out? Things are just heating up, we are in for an interesting season. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Let the world know your perspective.

The Washington Wizards thought so highly of him that they even gave out his bobblehead at one of their games. But golf? Well, this weekend, his long-time girlfriend, Ayan Broomfield, shared a reel on her Instagram account. In that video clip, Tiafoe was spotted giving a ride to Broomfield on a golf cart. Later on, both of them tried a few big swings on the lush green grass and Broomfield captioned that post with, “so, we suck ... but a Sunday afternoon well spent 🫶🏽.“ ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad After seeing this post, Frances Tiafoe shared that post on his social media with a cheeky caption: “Why you lying to the world and only posting my bad shots im him at golf 😂😂😂 @ayan.broomfield.” Perhaps, the American tennis star was a little embarrassed with his poor shot selections that were put on display in that video clip. A post shared by ayan broomfield (@ayan.broomfield) If we take a closer look at the craze for golf in the tennis world, Rafael Nadal is the first name that comes to attention. Do you know Rafael Nadal has competed in the Balearic Mid–Amateur Championship three times in the last four years, winning the 2024 editing? Even Norwegian star Casper Ruud once said, “Sometimes I dream that I could play in a tournament on the PGA Tour or European tour.” Meanwhile, the Australian tennis star, Alex de Mianaur, describes himself as an “Instagram golfer.” Well, for Tiafoe, this wasn’t the only time. In March last year, he shared a similar post where he was seen trying hands at golf. He had then shared a post on his IG stories with the caption, “I’m him, PERIOD.” Context? Renowned American rapper Kevin Gates popularized this term in 2019 when he released an album titled, “I’m him.” At that time, we saw NBA stars, including LeBron James and a few others, making his phrase a trend. This phrase is normally used to depict a dominant figure from a certain field but Tiafoe has perhaps used this to mock his golfing skills. Tiafoe claims he's 'him' at golf—do you think he can master the greens like the court? Debate Not only Tiafoe though, even his girlfriend is often seen trying her hands at this sport. In October 2024, Broomfield gave Frances Tiafoe a virtual tour of her progress on the golf course. She shared a glimpse of her big swing on a Facetime call, while Tiafoe was busy having a haircut at a barbershop. Frances Tiafoe and Ayan Broomfield have been together since 2015, and they’ve definitely become one of tennis’s favorite couples! Is it just the love for the sport which has brought them closer? Well, sports helped them meet each other, but mutual love and support brought them closer in the last few years. In a previous interview, Ayan Broomfield revealed, “We both played junior tennis at a very high level. I’m from Canada, so I was playing for my country, Frances was playing for the States.“ She further added, “And then one of our mutual friends was like, ‘Well, you guys actually would be really good friends.’ So we started talking then and became best friends for a bit. It’s been eight, nine years now. It’s been a journey.” So, that’s how it all began! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On Valentine’s Day this year, Ayan Broomfield dropped a romantic 3-word message on Frances Tiafoe’s post which captioned, “Happy v day to my day one. I love you baby and I’m sooo thankful for you everyday damn day. My rock, my everything @ayan.broomfield ❤️❤️.” And the way they support each other through thick and thin is insane! In 2023, when Frances Tiafoe had made it to the Top 10 for the first time in the men’s singles ranking, Broomfield’s heartfelt note to her boyfriend said, “You’ve rocked with me thru it all. The good the bad and the standstills. It’s been a ride no one can put into words. You mean more to me than you can ever imagine. I love you with all I got.” Now, since the 27-year-old Canadian has put tennis on the backseat, what are her goals for the near future? Well, in reply to this question in a previous interview, she highlighted, “Right now, the goal is to get Frances to be a Grand Slam champion. So right now, obviously I have stuff on the side that I’m doing that’s for me personally so that I feel self-fulfilled, but at the end of the day, that’s the goal that we’ve kind of sat down and thought about. That’s what we’re going to go after.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Do you think with the support of his girlfriend and his fans, Tiafoe can finally manage to change his fortunes in 2025?

She added that after the draft is prepared, the issue of putting it to a referendum will be decided. Galyan also emphasized that she will not comment on the content of the constitution's text. \"That will be reserved for the appropriate commission,\" she noted. The minister mentioned that certain clarifications regarding the electoral system are possible, focusing on a proportional representation system and excluding majoritarian elements. \"This implies not only constitutional changes but also amendments to the National Assembly's regulations,\" she stated. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, presenting the provisions of the \"Real Armenia\" ideology, has stated that adopting a new constitution through a nationwide referendum is essential. The Prime Minister emphasized that “adopting a new constitution via a nationwide referendum is important, as there is a significant lack of legitimacy concerning previous referendums in terms of public perception.”"

        "content": "By Dolores Quintana Writer and director Osgood Perkins’ follow-up to his acclaimed 2024 film Longlegs is another animal entirely. The Monkey is gob-stoppingly hilarious to behold and filled with existential thoughts about life and death. Even though The Monkey is brimming with bloody carnage and festive annihilation, it struck me as a very personal film. One that grapples with life’s basic unfairness and everyday terror that we all sublimate to survive. How does one deal with death, especially when it claims everyone you love? How does one live? Poor Chip. It is a film-length expansion of the already scary short story by Stephen King that had the same name. I have to be honest and say that the short story actually scared me pretty badly when I read it much too early as a young child, but the thing that always stuck with me was the paperback cover illustration of that damned monkey. While the film does explore the existential dread that comes with living, it is truly more of a comedy with exceptionally gruesome gore. However, Perkins, a master of tone, has managed to make the deeply unsettling and horrendously creative deaths float lightly on the screen rather than be weighted down with sturm and drang. You may never see so many deaths enacted before your eyes seem quite so, er, life-affirming? Yes, it is life-affirming. The film stars an admirable cast, including Theo James in a dual role, Tatiana Maslany, Christian Convery, Colin O’Brien, Rohan Campbell, Sarah Levy, Adam Scott, and Elijah Wood. All of the actors work beautifully well while waiting for their assorted fates. I don’t want to spoil the deaths, but the actors make sure that they remain memorable, even with the smallest amounts of screen time, so that you, the audience member, feel their absence. Even when characters fundamentally misunderstand why a character is gone, there’s a whisper of the real reason that is just out of reach, almost tangible, tantalizingly held over their heads. Perkins is a gifted director on more than one level, probably because he is an actor himself and has cast actors capable of these subtleties and the work of comedy. One character has a moment of such roaring courage that you feel a pang for what might have been had other characters had the benefit of his presence. It also comes into play later when the actions of another character echo the first character. The Monkey’s ritual is exceedingly well played. The lifting of the arm, the crack of the smile, and the animatronic artificiality are frightful but fascinating. You want to see The Monkey play its instrument, even while you gasp when it finally does. That is the see-saw of attraction and repulsion that lies at the center of The Monkey itself. You don’t want to feel its wrath, but don’t you just want to see it perform in some sick and secret way? People talk about “survivors’ guilt,” but no one ever talks about survivors’ relief. Maybe it is the same thing, cast as a more palatable idea, but aren’t you always a little relieved when it’s not your time? The synopsis is delivered on screen in the most matter-of-fact ways: “The monkey that likes killing our family is back.” But what Perkins has done that raises this film above many other King adaptations is that he has rooted it in mundane yet relatable reality. It is one of the most vicious sibling rivalries in film, and the comedic pain of being the kid who gets picked on constantly, no matter what he does, adds another dimension to farcical proceedings. That’s not fun, but Perkins makes it fun. Let the good times roll. But that is the core of the film. Life is what it is, and none of us can ever change our eventual fates no matter what we do, but what we do does matter. We never ask for what life chooses to dump on our heads, but how we manage the horror, with grace and humor or with anger and violence, makes us who we are, and since we are all interconnected, it shapes the fate of us all. How many hateful and vindictive people make others miserable, and what can the world be like when someone finds the strength to act out of love rather than fear?

        "content": "It’s been confirmed, Fakhar Zaman has been ruled out of the ICC Champions Trophy. The opener injured his back while fielding in the tournament opener and left the ground for the entire first innings. He returned to bat but was clearly hampered and lasted just 41 balls. “Fakhar Zaman has been deemed unfit for the rest of Pakistan’s Champions Trophy campaign. He sustained a knee injury during last night’s match. The scans following his injury aren’t promising, and he has been ruled out,” the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a release. The PCB has also confirmed that Imam-ul-Haq will replace Zaman in Pakistan’s squad for the ICC Champions Trophy. For the uninformed, Pakistan has now lost two openers to injury. Saim Ayub was ruled out a few days before the tournament, having failed to recover from an ankle injury sustained in early January in Cape Town. One can say that instead of making Babar Azam an opener, PCB should have brought in Imam. He averaged 53 in the Champions One-Day Cup 2024, Pakistan’s List A tournament, and also scored 98 runs in 94 balls against South Africa for Pakistan Shaheens in the ICC Champions Trophy warm-up match. Imam has a solid ODI record, with a healthy average of 48.27, albeit a low strike rate (82.55). The issue for Pakistan now would be their run rate. Imam isn’t an explosive batter like Fakhar and on the other end, you will have Babar, who isn’t exactly a quick scorer either.

The announcement comes as the digital transformation company celebrates its 25th anniversary. According to Rajesh Sinha, Founder and Chairman, the company is focusing on Intelligence Amplification (IA) to enhance human decision-making rather than replacing it. This approach represents what Fulcrum Digital sees as the fourth stage of digital maturity for enterprises. The company’s AI R&D hub in India is developing solutions designed to work alongside human teams. As part of this expansion, Fulcrum Digital plans to double its workforce to 3,000 employees, reinforcing its commitment to AI innovation. At the centre of this initiative is FD RYZE, described as a one-stop enterprise AI solution. The platform offers capabilities including knowledge base integration, multi-modal querying, comprehensive data access, AI-driven insights, and advanced automation. FD RYZE is already being implemented across multiple industries. An FMCG company uses it to digitise handwritten notes, while a food tech company employs the platform to convert natural language into SQL queries. A furniture retailer has connected FD RYZE with its HR SharePoint to provide instant responses to employee queries. Fulcrum Digital emphasises that its AI solutions are industry-agnostic and language model-agnostic, allowing enterprises to integrate AI without overhauling existing systems. The company reports these capabilities are delivering cost savings and operational efficiencies across sectors including financial services, insurance, and retail. Founded in 1999, Fulcrum Digital currently supports over 100 global clients from facilities in the US, Latin America, Europe, and India.
