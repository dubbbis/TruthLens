        "content": "[Written by Stephen Wright] Boxer Tyler Christopher is set to chase his tenth consecutive victory in the paid ranks when he steps into the ring against Englands Jordan Grannum on March 6. The middleweight bout will take place in Cannock, Staffordshire, on the undercard of the St Patricks Professional Boxing Dinner Show at the Premier Suite. It will mark Christophers first fight since his impressive points win over Cameroonian Serge Ambomo in Birmingham in May last year. Christopher will take a significant step forward in his career by competing in a six-round contest for the first time. The 32-year-old Grannum, a seasoned journeyman, has a wealth of experience, having won 12 and drawn five of his 168 bouts. Several boxing luminaries will be in attendance, including former world champions Barry McGuigan and Richie Woodhall, with the main event featuring Englands Cliff Henry against Irelands Ryan Whelan in a Midlands Area light heavyweight title showdown. Christopher, a slick southpaw, relocated to Birmingham more than five years ago to pursue his boxing dreams. He has been honing his craft at the D&A Boxing School of Excellence in Stirchley under the guidance of coach Anthony Hull. Read More About Category: All, Sports"

        "content": "The likes of Mel Kiper and Todd McShay are pioneers of the mock-drafting practice and draft analysis in general. Doubt they knew they were spurring chaos unto the sports realm. Draft analysis and all its iterations divide fans, stakeholders, and players alike into two factions. With some overlapping in the middle, sort of like a Venn diagram. Firstly, there are those who consider it a futile activity disassociated with reality. Then, those who consider certain peoples projections gospel and etched in fact. Finally, those who have no strong opinions take them on board but with a pinch of salt. After looking at one persons QB rankings for Aprils NFL Draft, Quinn Ewers will firmly fall into category 1. The curious case of Quinn Ewers. A 5-star prospect coming out of high school whose stock seemingly declined year upon year in college. The 2024 draft saw the most QBs picked in the first round ever. With the competition being that tough, Ewers chose to stick around and enter the draft in 2025 instead. However, hes actually lost ground during a year riddled with injuries. Hes even nursing one to his oblique right now and missed the Senior Bowl as a result. The consensus on Quinn Ewers is that hell be a Day 2 or 3 pick off the board. Not ideal, but still far from an indictment. However, those health concerns run deeper than a receiving route. Theyve now seeped into his NFL grade. CBS Danny Kanell has issued a public warning to front offices eyeing up Ewers. Injuries plagued Quinn Ewers entire college career. After missing time in the 2023 season with an AC joint sprain, he found no respite last season, either. Back in Week 3, he went down with an oblique strain. Ewers returned in Week 7 while Arch Manning held it down in his absence. Turns out, he never fully healed from this injury and played the rest of the year through it. After Texas season ceased in the Cotton Bowl, this finally came to light. With all this and more baked in, Kanell ranks Ewers as the 6th best quarterback in this class. He gave his reasons on CBS Sports HQ. Discerning that all his regression stems from persistent health issues. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad I worry about two things. One, the top tier arm strength. Two are injuries, remarked Kanell. Ewers did not finish any season from start to finish. I wonder how much those injuries impacted his arm strength. The deeper [throws] started to bloop a little bit, started to hang in. Ewers mobility in and out of the pocket was also visibly hindered after he returned last year. His arm strength and mobility, or lack thereof, can also be viewed from a different POVparalysis by analysis. Knowing hes got a future in the NFL beckoning, Ewers could have had issues with confidence or a fear of re-injury. He didnt look like the guy he was from even a year ago. Maybe Arch Manning breathing down his neck was also a factor for him to oversimplify his game. Ewers was largely cruising through games in 2nd gear. Whether this was physical or mental, neither bodes well for franchises weighing him up. Quinn Ewers not partaking in the Senior Bowl means the Combine is ultra important for him to shed concerns about his tangibles and health. But things en route to Indy are looking bleak. Alas, there have even been suggestions that he shouldve returned to college for yet another year. An idea that gained traction after Bengals QB Joe Burrow fanned the flames of it. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Burrow hints at agreeing with the notion Quinn Ewers shouldve remained in College Football There may not be a lot of similarities between Joe Burrow and Quinn Ewers in how theyre perceived entering the NFL. Burrow was a Heisman winner and National Champ with LSU. However, theres one transitive property- both were recruited by Ohio State. Before leaving for greener pastures. Burrow didnt have the portal, though, so he had to graduate before switching base. Neither did he have as many or as lucrative NIL avenues. He spoke about this and implied Quinn Ewers and his kind should consider staying in college longer now. Owing to the money on offer. You should take advantage of NIL, he told Dan Patrick. If youre going to be able to make seven figures in college, youve got to go and take advantage of that. If youre in high school and youre getting offered that, go wherever theyre paying you the most, This came right after Patrick asked him about Ewers. Now, Burrow perhaps didnt mean to direct his statement to Quinn in particular, but it still resounds. Given the market, Ewers couldve likely made more money this season playing CFB than hell make during the entirety of his rookie-scale contract as a late-round pick! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ewers will just hope a solid organization takes a chance on him. The situation a malleable QB walks into can dictate the trajectory of their career. Hell likely have to sit initially wherever he goes. If its an environment conducive to growth, Ewers could well get back to the levels expected of him out of high school. Hes vying for limited landing spots with a bunch of adversaries. There are still a lot of pages left of his story. Albeit injuries have indeed torn some pages out of the proverbial book of his career."

        "content": "In wake of recent remarks, the outside observer might assume there is tension between Red Sox stars Rafael Devers and Alex Bregman. That doesnt seem to be the case, however. Devers made his desires abundantly clear after Boston signed Bregman, bluntly stating that he wanted to stay at third base and had no interest in moving to another position. But that wasnt necessarily a shot at Bregman, who Devers referred to as a great guy and a great addition to the Red Soxs roster. Bregman returned the favor Tuesday when he called Devers a great player and stressed he was super excited to be the three-time All-Stars teammate. The two-time World Series champion also pulled back the curtain on his early interactions with Bostons franchise cornerstone. Theyve been great. Weve been having a lot of fun, Bregman told reporters, per MLB.com. Weve been taking ground balls back here, during our work together. Talking about winning. Talking about baseball. Talking about being excited for the season. Last night we all got together and had dinner. Its great. Story continues below advertisement Bregmans comments corroborated a claim made by Alex Cora, who insisted there was no beef between the pair of star infielders. The Red Sox manager also pointed out how Bregman and Devers had a very lengthy conversation on Bostons first day of full-squad workouts. The Red Sox have quite a bit to figure out before the regular season gets underway in late March. But no matter what Cora decides to do with his talented roster, it seems like all players will buy in for the sake of the greater good."

        "content": "Malware-as-a-Service accounts for 57 percent of all threats By Ian Barker A new report from Darktrace reveals that Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is now responsible for 57 percent of all cyber threats to organizations, a 17 percent increase from the first half of 2024. The use of remote access trojans (RATs) has also seen a significant increase in the latter half of last year, representing 46 percent of campaign activity identified, compared to only 12 percent in the first half. Phishing remains attackers preferred technique, with over 30.4 million phishing emails detected across Darktraces customer base between December 2023 and December 2024. The techniques observed highlight how threat actors continue to curate more targeted and sophisticated emails to improve the success of their campaigns. Of all the phishing emails detected in 2024 38 percent were spear-phishing attempts, tailored attacks on high value individuals, while 32 percent used novel social engineering techniques like QR codes and AI generated text. Whats also concerning is that 70 percent of phishing emails successfully passed the widely used DMARC authentication approach and 55 percent passed through all existing security layers before Darktrace detection. Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace, says, Email is at the forefront of the evolving threats were seeing across the threat landscape. Ransomware-as-a-Service tools, combined with the growing use of AI, are allowing even low-skilled attackers to engineer convincing, targeted email attacks at scale, and making it harder than ever for traditional security measures to keep up. Some of the most significant campaigns observed in 2024 involved the ongoing exploitation of vulnerabilities in edge and perimeter network technologies, with 40 percent of identified campaign activity in the first half of the year involving the exploitation of internet-facing devices. The combination of Cybercrime-as-a-Service, automation and AI are increasing the sophistication and diversity of attack techniques faster than ever  from AI-enhanced phishing campaigns to evolving ransomware strains, adds Jones. Detecting and responding to threats in progress is no longer sufficient. Organizations must prioritize cyber resilience by proactively addressing weaknesses across systems, people, and data before attackers can exploit them. You can find out more on the Darktrace blog.

Its #9 vs #12 as Brendan Allen returns after almost five months to butt heads against Anthony Hernandez, who riding high with momentum on his side with a 6-fight winning streak under his belt. While talking about the title contenders in the 185-pound division that includes some of the top stars in the promotion, we often lose sight of whats cooking on the lower side of the rankings. Brendan All In Allen and Anthony Fluffy Hernandez are both making waves with impressive performances, so lets take a look at how their fight could end this weekend. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad UFC Seattle: Brendan Allen vs. Anthony Hernandez stats As high-stakes a fight as it seems, its also a rematch between Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez. Before they fought in the UFC, the middleweight duo had their first scrap back in 2018 when they were competing under the Legacy Fighting Alliance banner. All In may be ranked higher than his 31-year-old counterpart now, but on that night, the South Carolina native came up short as he lost to his Fluffy via a decision win. But since then, Brendan Allen has gone on to amass an incredible record of 24 wins with only six losses. But the 29-year-olds opponent hasnt had quite as many fights as Anthony Hernandezs record stands at 13 wins and 2 losses. Despite that, the less experienced of the two has a better win percentage. When we look at the other stats, Brendan Allen has lived up to his BJJ black belt status by racking up 14 submission wins and 5 knockouts to go along with it. In fact, the majority of the South Carolina natives fights have ended with a finish, which is somewhat similar to Anthony Hernandez, whos got 11 finishes to his name. In terms of styles, both fighters are, as Mike Goldberg would say, virtually identical. In terms of physical stats, theres not much of a difference between Allen and Hernandez as well. But the former does have a 2-inch height advantage, which may not mean much because it doesnt give him an edge in terms of reach. Now, lets move over to make a final analysis and prediction for the UFC Seattle co-main event. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Allen vs. Hernandez breakdown and prediction It wont be wrong to assume that since their last meeting, Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez have made a tremendous jump in their skill levels. While the latter is currently on a winning streak, All In was in an unbeaten run before losing to Israel Adesanya-slaying Nassourdine Imavov in his last fight. But experience plays a big role in a fight and an edge 24-6 fighter might have the edge here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nevertheless, Anthony Hernande, in the run that hes in right now, has more than showcased his relentlessness and that hes got grit, and his exceptional cardio is something to watch out for. The oddsmakers, meanwhile, have shoved aside the experience factor and have favored Hernandez with their numbers. While Brendan Allen will be heading into the fight as the +240 underdog, his opponent has been picked as the -280 favorite. With a win in their last outing, the California native may take home the win this weekend. Who do you think will win this time around? Will the winner of the UFC Seattle co-main event be Brendan Allen of Anthony Hernandez? Let us know in the comments down below."

        "content": "Four women who allege they were sexually abused by the social media influencer Andrew Tate have urged the US not to interfere in his case in Romania. The women said they were extremely concerned by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, who have dual UK-US nationality. Lawyer Matthew Jury, who is representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC they were absolutely bewildered why the Trump administration has decided to interfere in this way, although Romania denies being pressured by the US. Tate, 38, and his brother were arrested in Romania three years ago and face trial on allegations of rape, trafficking minors and money laundering, all of which they deny. Separately, the brothers are wanted by police in the UK over allegations of rape and human trafficking, which they also deny. Their extradition to the UK will be dealt with once the Romania case finishes. The Financial Times newspaper first reported that US officials had brought up the case with the Romanian government last week, and it was then followed up by Trumps envoy Richard Grenell at the weekend. One source told the paper that a request had been made by the US to return the brothers passports to them so they could travel while waiting for the criminal case against them to finish. The Tate brothers are currently banned from leaving Romania, although are no longer under house arrest. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu confirmed to Euronews that Grenell had raised Tates case with him, and that Grenell had said he was interested in the fate of the Tate brothers. The minister denied this amounted to pressure from Americans. A spokesperson for Mr Hurezeanu told the Financial Times: Romanian courts are independent and operate based on the law, there is due process. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu also denied the reports on X, writing: [The US] has not made any requests to [Romania] upon the legal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by the Romanian authorities. There were no demands either during the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- Richard Grenell discussion or after it. Romania and USA share the same values regarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. According to the FT, Grenell said he had no substantive conversation with Hurezeanu, but added: I support the Tate brothers as evident by my publicly available tweets. The US State Department has been approached by the BBC for comment. The Tate brothers have wide support on right-wing social media, and supported Trump during the US election campaign. Lawyer Mr Jury said: Its very clear from members of the Trump administrations social media posts and public statements that there is a great deal of support for Tate. Either they dont know or they dont care about the nature of the allegations and how serious they are, he told BBC Newsnight. He said the women he represented were absolutely distraught. To see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser, is incredibly traumatising its gaslighting of a sort. And he called the reported US actions a gross interference in my clients right to a fair trial and due process. Mr Jury is representing the four women in a civil case against Tate at the High Court in the UK, after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute their case. The Tate brothers deny the claims. The civil case is separate to the criminal allegations currently being investigated by British police. In their statement, the four women added: We hope that the Romanian and the UK authorities will be left alone to do their jobs. (BBC News)"

        "content": "Pam Shrivers story, from the 1980s, is a chilling reminder of the potential for abuse in sports. Starting with her coach Don Candy at just nine, she rose to tennis stardom, but their relationship turned into an inappropriate and damaging affair, marked by emotional abuse. Now, 4 decades later, were seeing similar red flags with Elena Rybakina and her coach, Stefano Vukov. The 37-year-olds verbal abuse has been well-documented, with him calling Rybakina stupid and telling her that without him she would still be in Russia picking potatoes. One of his most vocal critics has been Rennae Stubbs. Turns out, theres a reason for Stubbss strong stance  they have a history. On February 12, WTA released a statement following an internal investigation against Vukov. Prior to the investigations completion, Vukov was momentarily suspended. But now, the penalty has got elongated. The suspension remains in place. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of the investigation and its findings, the WTA will not provide further details. We remain committed to ensuring that all matters are handled in a fair and objective manner in accordance with the WTA Code of Conduct, read the statement from the agency. Stubbs was quite happy about this news. Expressing her unfiltered opinions, in an episode of her podcast, dated February 15, she said, I think, quite honestly, he should be banned forever on the WTA tour. He should not be allowed to be able to come on the tour and work with any girl because thats his tendency. Well, now shes backed up her words with proof. And guess what? Its coming right from Stubbs own experience with Vukov. But what exactly happened between them? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a new episode of her podcast, dated February 19, Stubbs talked about how WTA took crucial information from different witnesses in its investigation. She then revealed, Listen, I have coached, I have been coached. I have seen other coaches. I know what abuse is. And he is abusive to her. PeriodI could have been one of those witnesses, and I probably was one of those witnesses. But how? Well, its because they interviewed me years ago about him, okay. Because I made comments on this podcast years ago about him, and I never said anything about him abusing her. So what did she tell WTAs team about the Croatians influence on Rybakina? I just said he was very negative, and I felt like with a positive coach how much better could she be. Imagine how good she could be with a really positive coach. And so those are the comments I made about him, she added. However, what happened next completely shocked Stubbs. She revealed that he (Vukov) contacted the WTA and wanted to come after me for making those comments. Stubbs never made this incident public. But after WTAs statement on Vukov last week, she thought it was time to spill the beans. He came after me and wanted to sue me, okay, for saying things about him that were true, that have been now investigated for years, are now true. But it appears there are even more details regarding Vukov that were hitherto unknown. A latest report throws light on how he once allegedly disrespected Rybakinas mothers request! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad When Stefano Vukov reacted harshly to Elena Rybakinas mothers desperate plea A report by The Athletic, dated February 18, revealed tons of new details on Elena Rybakinas ex-coach. It also mentioned various instances involving Vukovs rude conduct with the former World No.3. As it turns out, WTAs chief executive officer Portia Archer submitted a three-page summary to Vukov. In that, she mentioned how he broke the Tours Code of Conduct by ridiculing and abusing the Kazakh tennis player. Archer also wrote that Vukov told Rybakina that without him, she would still be in Russia picking potatoes. Eventually, his tendency to push her beyond her limits caused her physical illness. Thats the reason why Rybakina, perhaps, withdrew from several WTA events last season. The report from Archer further revealed that Rybakinas mother was aware of Vukovs toxic behavior. In fact, she even asked him not to make her daughter cry again. But Vukov didnt acknowledge her request. Instead, he then pulled out from one of the events, refusing to coach the 2023 Australian Open runner-up. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On the other hand, Rybakinas still defending her former coach. Despite WTAs extended ban on him, she believes whatever has happened to him is just not right. Currently, shes competing at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Following a first round victory over Japans Moyuka Uchijima, she reiterated her stance on Vukov. Its very disappointing the way its been handled, just the outcome. Furthermore, she also cited a lack of support from fellow WTA players. There are couple players Im in touch more. But to say that I have very, very close friends on tour, its I think not true just because we competing against each other. Everybodys surrounded by their teams. Amid all this chaos in her life, it seems her focus is completely on tennis at the moment. She just outclassed Paula Badosa in her second round in Dubai."

        "content": "Ten days from now, the Humane AI Pin will be able to tell you how much battery it has left, and essentially nothing else. To be fair, though, it couldnt do that much before. And it doesnt matter anyway, because you almost certainly didnt buy one. But if you did, thats the bad news: Humane is shutting down the AI Pin  almost exactly a year after it first started shipping the little chest-mounted device  and has sold some of its remnant technology to HP. The details here are brutal for everyone involved. The $116 million HP is paying pales next to the $230 million the company raised since it was founded in 2018. (There was a rumor last spring that Humane was trying to sell to HP for somewhere near $1 billion.) The companys founders, Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, have now gone from celebrated Apple product makers to working on AI stuff for HPs printers and conference room gadgets. Pin owners will be stuck with a $699 paperweight, since Humane is neither offering refunds outside the normal 90-day purchase window nor appears to have a plan to open-source or otherwise make available any of its software. Its all just over. Humane will go down in the annals of tech history as one of the most spectacular gadget failures of all time, up there with Quibi, the Fire Phone, and the Apple Newton. The company never seemed to put a foot right. It labored in secret for years, building relentless hype, before first showing off the device in an overwrought, thoroughly confusing TED talk in which Chaudhri mysteriously got the Pin to translate a sentence to French without ever asking it to, and answered a phone call by doing nothing. Knowing what we know now, it seems virtually impossible that the demo wasnt mostly or entirely a fake. Humane was hellbent on convincing everyone that the Pin was the future, and that the future was here right now. It called that TED talk The Disappearing Computer, and pitched its device as the first true AI gadget  and maybe the successor to the smartphone. Humane made a big deal out of its announcement of the products name, and had its device declared one of Times Best Inventions of 2023 before the thing ever actually shipped. (Surely its a coincidence that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff both owns Time and invested in Humane, right?) The company delayed the Pins launch, before ignoring panicked warnings from early testers who said the device was woefully unfinished and shipping the thing anyway. The Pin tried to be all things to all people, and just never pulled it off. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Even if the Pin had been, lets say, pretty good, it would have felt like a disappointment after all that build-up. But the Pin was junk. I gave it a 4 / 10 in my review last year, and in retrospect I was too generous. There were certainly a few impressive things about it: it was small and sturdy and genuinely nice to hold and look at. As any good student of Apple design knows, though, design is how you use it. And using the Pin was a study in disappointment. The Pin couldnt do much  it shipped without features as basic as a timer or an alarm, and was missing a number of the features Chaudhri demoed during his TED Talk. What it could do, it did sporadically and mostly poorly. The battery didnt last very long, not that you could ever test it  the Pin overheated so quickly even in moderate use that it shut itself down long before it died. Oh, and did I mention it was SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE DOLLARS? Plus a mandatory $24 monthly charge for cell service? Forget pretty good, the Pin would have had to be great to be worth it. At least Rabbit had the good sense to only charge $200 for the similarly crummy R1  and to make it orange and fun to fiddle with. At least Rabbit had the good sense to only charge $200 To its credit, Humane eventually updated the Pin to add some missing software features and fix a bunch of what was broken, and the Pin will certainly be a better device on its last day than on its first. But it never mattered. Pretty quickly, Pin returns started to outweigh Pin sales. Humane had to recall the Pins charging case, which was an overheating risk. The company had always planned to make its operating system, called CosmOS, into a platform for other developers and hardware manufacturers to use, but waited too long and found no takers. Some of this, a lot of it even, was self-inflicted. Humane just tried to do too much, and reinvent too many things, that it would have had to execute at unheard-of levels for a first-time startup to pull it off. But Humane also made a huge bet on AI technology that, while it continues to improve, also continues to be woefully inadequate for most things. Were only now seeing companies like OpenAI begin to slowly give their models these so-called agentic capabilities, so they can go book you Airbnbs or remind you to pick up flowers. When all that works perfectly, when AI models are integrated seamlessly with every app and service and real-time detail of our lives, maybe a totally interface-less device like the Pin will be useful. But if thats ever going to happen, its not going to be soon. Whats most damning in the Humane story, though, is how much the company was right about. The time was ripe for a first mass adoption of AI  but ChatGPT and Claude figured out the user interface people actually want right now. There are opportunities for new kinds of gadgets  but theyre going to look more like glasses than brooches. People do increasingly want faster, easier, less screen-based ways to interact with technology  but the voice assistant on their phone and in their ears is a lot more useful than a laser projector on their hand. Humane saw the big picture mostly correctly, and it utterly botched the details. Since Humanes failed launch, Ive heard from multiple startup founders who were considering launching gadgets with AI features that decided to change course after seeing what happened to Humane. The company promised to kick off the AI gadget revolution, but if anything it set it back."

        "content": "The likes of Mel Kiper and Todd McShay are pioneers of the mock-drafting practice and draft analysis in general. Doubt they knew they were spurring chaos unto the sports realm. Draft analysis and all its iterations divide fans, stakeholders, and players alike into two factions. With some overlapping in the middle, sort of like a Venn diagram. Firstly, there are those who consider it a futile activity disassociated with reality. Then, those who consider certain peoples projections gospel and etched in fact. Finally, those who have no strong opinions take them on board but with a pinch of salt. After looking at one persons QB rankings for Aprils NFL Draft, Quinn Ewers will firmly fall into category 1. The curious case of Quinn Ewers. A 5-star prospect coming out of high school whose stock seemingly declined year upon year in college. The 2024 draft saw the most QBs picked in the first round ever. With the competition being that tough, Ewers chose to stick around and enter the draft in 2025 instead. However, hes actually lost ground during a year riddled with injuries. Hes even nursing one to his oblique right now and missed the Senior Bowl as a result. The consensus on Quinn Ewers is that hell be a Day 2 or 3 pick off the board. Not ideal, but still far from an indictment. However, those health concerns run deeper than a receiving route. Theyve now seeped into his NFL grade. CBS Danny Kanell has issued a public warning to front offices eyeing up Ewers. Injuries plagued Quinn Ewers entire college career. After missing time in the 2023 season with an AC joint sprain, he found no respite last season, either. Back in Week 3, he went down with an oblique strain. Ewers returned in Week 7 while Arch Manning held it down in his absence. Turns out, he never fully healed from this injury and played the rest of the year through it. After Texas season ceased in the Cotton Bowl, this finally came to light. With all this and more baked in, Kanell ranks Ewers as the 6th best quarterback in this class. He gave his reasons on CBS Sports HQ. Discerning that all his regression stems from persistent health issues. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad I worry about two things. One, the top tier arm strength. Two are injuries, remarked Kanell. Ewers did not finish any season from start to finish. I wonder how much those injuries impacted his arm strength. The deeper [throws] started to bloop a little bit, started to hang in. Ewers mobility in and out of the pocket was also visibly hindered after he returned last year. His arm strength and mobility, or lack thereof, can also be viewed from a different POVparalysis by analysis. Knowing hes got a future in the NFL beckoning, Ewers could have had issues with confidence or a fear of re-injury. He didnt look like the guy he was from even a year ago. Maybe Arch Manning breathing down his neck was also a factor for him to oversimplify his game. Ewers was largely cruising through games in 2nd gear. Whether this was physical or mental, neither bodes well for franchises weighing him up. Quinn Ewers not partaking in the Senior Bowl means the Combine is ultra important for him to shed concerns about his tangibles and health. But things en route to Indy are looking bleak. Alas, there have even been suggestions that he shouldve returned to college for yet another year. An idea that gained traction after Bengals QB Joe Burrow fanned the flames of it. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Burrow hints at agreeing with the notion Quinn Ewers shouldve remained in College Football There may not be a lot of similarities between Joe Burrow and Quinn Ewers in how theyre perceived entering the NFL. Burrow was a Heisman winner and National Champ with LSU. However, theres one transitive property- both were recruited by Ohio State. Before leaving for greener pastures. Burrow didnt have the portal, though, so he had to graduate before switching base. Neither did he have as many or as lucrative NIL avenues. He spoke about this and implied Quinn Ewers and his kind should consider staying in college longer now. Owing to the money on offer. You should take advantage of NIL, he told Dan Patrick. If youre going to be able to make seven figures in college, youve got to go and take advantage of that. If youre in high school and youre getting offered that, go wherever theyre paying you the most, This came right after Patrick asked him about Ewers. Now, Burrow perhaps didnt mean to direct his statement to Quinn in particular, but it still resounds. Given the market, Ewers couldve likely made more money this season playing CFB than hell make during the entirety of his rookie-scale contract as a late-round pick! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ewers will just hope a solid organization takes a chance on him. The situation a malleable QB walks into can dictate the trajectory of their career. Hell likely have to sit initially wherever he goes. If its an environment conducive to growth, Ewers could well get back to the levels expected of him out of high school. Hes vying for limited landing spots with a bunch of adversaries. There are still a lot of pages left of his story. Albeit injuries have indeed torn some pages out of the proverbial book of his career."

        "content": "In wake of recent remarks, the outside observer might assume there is tension between Red Sox stars Rafael Devers and Alex Bregman. That doesnt seem to be the case, however. Devers made his desires abundantly clear after Boston signed Bregman, bluntly stating that he wanted to stay at third base and had no interest in moving to another position. But that wasnt necessarily a shot at Bregman, who Devers referred to as a great guy and a great addition to the Red Soxs roster. Bregman returned the favor Tuesday when he called Devers a great player and stressed he was super excited to be the three-time All-Stars teammate. The two-time World Series champion also pulled back the curtain on his early interactions with Bostons franchise cornerstone. Theyve been great. Weve been having a lot of fun, Bregman told reporters, per MLB.com. Weve been taking ground balls back here, during our work together. Talking about winning. Talking about baseball. Talking about being excited for the season. Last night we all got together and had dinner. Its great. Story continues below advertisement Bregmans comments corroborated a claim made by Alex Cora, who insisted there was no beef between the pair of star infielders. The Red Sox manager also pointed out how Bregman and Devers had a very lengthy conversation on Bostons first day of full-squad workouts. The Red Sox have quite a bit to figure out before the regular season gets underway in late March. But no matter what Cora decides to do with his talented roster, it seems like all players will buy in for the sake of the greater good."

        "content": "Malware-as-a-Service accounts for 57 percent of all threats By Ian Barker A new report from Darktrace reveals that Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is now responsible for 57 percent of all cyber threats to organizations, a 17 percent increase from the first half of 2024. The use of remote access trojans (RATs) has also seen a significant increase in the latter half of last year, representing 46 percent of campaign activity identified, compared to only 12 percent in the first half. Phishing remains attackers preferred technique, with over 30.4 million phishing emails detected across Darktraces customer base between December 2023 and December 2024. The techniques observed highlight how threat actors continue to curate more targeted and sophisticated emails to improve the success of their campaigns. Of all the phishing emails detected in 2024 38 percent were spear-phishing attempts, tailored attacks on high value individuals, while 32 percent used novel social engineering techniques like QR codes and AI generated text. Whats also concerning is that 70 percent of phishing emails successfully passed the widely used DMARC authentication approach and 55 percent passed through all existing security layers before Darktrace detection. Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace, says, Email is at the forefront of the evolving threats were seeing across the threat landscape. Ransomware-as-a-Service tools, combined with the growing use of AI, are allowing even low-skilled attackers to engineer convincing, targeted email attacks at scale, and making it harder than ever for traditional security measures to keep up. Some of the most significant campaigns observed in 2024 involved the ongoing exploitation of vulnerabilities in edge and perimeter network technologies, with 40 percent of identified campaign activity in the first half of the year involving the exploitation of internet-facing devices. The combination of Cybercrime-as-a-Service, automation and AI are increasing the sophistication and diversity of attack techniques faster than ever  from AI-enhanced phishing campaigns to evolving ransomware strains, adds Jones. Detecting and responding to threats in progress is no longer sufficient. Organizations must prioritize cyber resilience by proactively addressing weaknesses across systems, people, and data before attackers can exploit them. You can find out more on the Darktrace blog.

        "content": "As Henry Cejudo returns to headline UFC Seattle against Song Yadong, this Fight Night has a high-stakes co-main event between two ranked middleweight contenders. Its #9 vs #12 as Brendan Allen returns after almost five months to butt heads against Anthony Hernandez, who riding high with momentum on his side with a 6-fight winning streak under his belt. While talking about the title contenders in the 185-pound division that includes some of the top stars in the promotion, we often lose sight of whats cooking on the lower side of the rankings. Brendan All In Allen and Anthony Fluffy Hernandez are both making waves with impressive performances, so lets take a look at how their fight could end this weekend. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad UFC Seattle: Brendan Allen vs. Anthony Hernandez stats As high-stakes a fight as it seems, its also a rematch between Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez. Before they fought in the UFC, the middleweight duo had their first scrap back in 2018 when they were competing under the Legacy Fighting Alliance banner. All In may be ranked higher than his 31-year-old counterpart now, but on that night, the South Carolina native came up short as he lost to his Fluffy via a decision win. But since then, Brendan Allen has gone on to amass an incredible record of 24 wins with only six losses. But the 29-year-olds opponent hasnt had quite as many fights as Anthony Hernandezs record stands at 13 wins and 2 losses. Despite that, the less experienced of the two has a better win percentage. When we look at the other stats, Brendan Allen has lived up to his BJJ black belt status by racking up 14 submission wins and 5 knockouts to go along with it. In fact, the majority of the South Carolina natives fights have ended with a finish, which is somewhat similar to Anthony Hernandez, whos got 11 finishes to his name. In terms of styles, both fighters are, as Mike Goldberg would say, virtually identical. In terms of physical stats, theres not much of a difference between Allen and Hernandez as well. But the former does have a 2-inch height advantage, which may not mean much because it doesnt give him an edge in terms of reach. Now, lets move over to make a final analysis and prediction for the UFC Seattle co-main event. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Allen vs. Hernandez breakdown and prediction It wont be wrong to assume that since their last meeting, Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez have made a tremendous jump in their skill levels. While the latter is currently on a winning streak, All In was in an unbeaten run before losing to Israel Adesanya-slaying Nassourdine Imavov in his last fight. But experience plays a big role in a fight and an edge 24-6 fighter might have the edge here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nevertheless, Anthony Hernande, in the run that hes in right now, has more than showcased his relentlessness and that hes got grit, and his exceptional cardio is something to watch out for. The oddsmakers, meanwhile, have shoved aside the experience factor and have favored Hernandez with their numbers. While Brendan Allen will be heading into the fight as the +240 underdog, his opponent has been picked as the -280 favorite. With a win in their last outing, the California native may take home the win this weekend. Who do you think will win this time around? Will the winner of the UFC Seattle co-main event be Brendan Allen of Anthony Hernandez? Let us know in the comments down below."

        "content": "Four women who allege they were sexually abused by the social media influencer Andrew Tate have urged the US not to interfere in his case in Romania. The women said they were extremely concerned by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, who have dual UK-US nationality. Lawyer Matthew Jury, who is representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC they were absolutely bewildered why the Trump administration has decided to interfere in this way, although Romania denies being pressured by the US. Tate, 38, and his brother were arrested in Romania three years ago and face trial on allegations of rape, trafficking minors and money laundering, all of which they deny. Separately, the brothers are wanted by police in the UK over allegations of rape and human trafficking, which they also deny. Their extradition to the UK will be dealt with once the Romania case finishes. The Financial Times newspaper first reported that US officials had brought up the case with the Romanian government last week, and it was then followed up by Trumps envoy Richard Grenell at the weekend. One source told the paper that a request had been made by the US to return the brothers passports to them so they could travel while waiting for the criminal case against them to finish. The Tate brothers are currently banned from leaving Romania, although are no longer under house arrest. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu confirmed to Euronews that Grenell had raised Tates case with him, and that Grenell had said he was interested in the fate of the Tate brothers. The minister denied this amounted to pressure from Americans. A spokesperson for Mr Hurezeanu told the Financial Times: Romanian courts are independent and operate based on the law, there is due process. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu also denied the reports on X, writing: [The US] has not made any requests to [Romania] upon the legal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by the Romanian authorities. There were no demands either during the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- Richard Grenell discussion or after it. Romania and USA share the same values regarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. According to the FT, Grenell said he had no substantive conversation with Hurezeanu, but added: I support the Tate brothers as evident by my publicly available tweets. The US State Department has been approached by the BBC for comment. The Tate brothers have wide support on right-wing social media, and supported Trump during the US election campaign. Lawyer Mr Jury said: Its very clear from members of the Trump administrations social media posts and public statements that there is a great deal of support for Tate. Either they dont know or they dont care about the nature of the allegations and how serious they are, he told BBC Newsnight. He said the women he represented were absolutely distraught. To see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser, is incredibly traumatising its gaslighting of a sort. And he called the reported US actions a gross interference in my clients right to a fair trial and due process. Mr Jury is representing the four women in a civil case against Tate at the High Court in the UK, after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute their case. The Tate brothers deny the claims. The civil case is separate to the criminal allegations currently being investigated by British police. In their statement, the four women added: We hope that the Romanian and the UK authorities will be left alone to do their jobs. (BBC News)"

        "content": "Pam Shrivers story, from the 1980s, is a chilling reminder of the potential for abuse in sports. Starting with her coach Don Candy at just nine, she rose to tennis stardom, but their relationship turned into an inappropriate and damaging affair, marked by emotional abuse. Now, 4 decades later, were seeing similar red flags with Elena Rybakina and her coach, Stefano Vukov. The 37-year-olds verbal abuse has been well-documented, with him calling Rybakina stupid and telling her that without him she would still be in Russia picking potatoes. One of his most vocal critics has been Rennae Stubbs. Turns out, theres a reason for Stubbss strong stance  they have a history. On February 12, WTA released a statement following an internal investigation against Vukov. Prior to the investigations completion, Vukov was momentarily suspended. But now, the penalty has got elongated. The suspension remains in place. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of the investigation and its findings, the WTA will not provide further details. We remain committed to ensuring that all matters are handled in a fair and objective manner in accordance with the WTA Code of Conduct, read the statement from the agency. Stubbs was quite happy about this news. Expressing her unfiltered opinions, in an episode of her podcast, dated February 15, she said, I think, quite honestly, he should be banned forever on the WTA tour. He should not be allowed to be able to come on the tour and work with any girl because thats his tendency. Well, now shes backed up her words with proof. And guess what? Its coming right from Stubbs own experience with Vukov. But what exactly happened between them? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a new episode of her podcast, dated February 19, Stubbs talked about how WTA took crucial information from different witnesses in its investigation. She then revealed, Listen, I have coached, I have been coached. I have seen other coaches. I know what abuse is. And he is abusive to her. PeriodI could have been one of those witnesses, and I probably was one of those witnesses. But how? Well, its because they interviewed me years ago about him, okay. Because I made comments on this podcast years ago about him, and I never said anything about him abusing her. So what did she tell WTAs team about the Croatians influence on Rybakina? I just said he was very negative, and I felt like with a positive coach how much better could she be. Imagine how good she could be with a really positive coach. And so those are the comments I made about him, she added. However, what happened next completely shocked Stubbs. She revealed that he (Vukov) contacted the WTA and wanted to come after me for making those comments. Stubbs never made this incident public. But after WTAs statement on Vukov last week, she thought it was time to spill the beans. He came after me and wanted to sue me, okay, for saying things about him that were true, that have been now investigated for years, are now true. But it appears there are even more details regarding Vukov that were hitherto unknown. A latest report throws light on how he once allegedly disrespected Rybakinas mothers request! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad When Stefano Vukov reacted harshly to Elena Rybakinas mothers desperate plea A report by The Athletic, dated February 18, revealed tons of new details on Elena Rybakinas ex-coach. It also mentioned various instances involving Vukovs rude conduct with the former World No.3. As it turns out, WTAs chief executive officer Portia Archer submitted a three-page summary to Vukov. In that, she mentioned how he broke the Tours Code of Conduct by ridiculing and abusing the Kazakh tennis player. Archer also wrote that Vukov told Rybakina that without him, she would still be in Russia picking potatoes. Eventually, his tendency to push her beyond her limits caused her physical illness. Thats the reason why Rybakina, perhaps, withdrew from several WTA events last season. The report from Archer further revealed that Rybakinas mother was aware of Vukovs toxic behavior. In fact, she even asked him not to make her daughter cry again. But Vukov didnt acknowledge her request. Instead, he then pulled out from one of the events, refusing to coach the 2023 Australian Open runner-up. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On the other hand, Rybakinas still defending her former coach. Despite WTAs extended ban on him, she believes whatever has happened to him is just not right. Currently, shes competing at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Following a first round victory over Japans Moyuka Uchijima, she reiterated her stance on Vukov. Its very disappointing the way its been handled, just the outcome. Furthermore, she also cited a lack of support from fellow WTA players. There are couple players Im in touch more. But to say that I have very, very close friends on tour, its I think not true just because we competing against each other. Everybodys surrounded by their teams. Amid all this chaos in her life, it seems her focus is completely on tennis at the moment. She just outclassed Paula Badosa in her second round in Dubai."

Apple has confirmed that its launching a new product today, and we think itll be the new iPhone SE. It could mark a major shake-up to the companys affordable iPhone line, adding in Face ID and killing off the classic home button. We dont expect Apple to hold a full launch event for the new SE, instead simply announcing the phone on its website. We dont know what time, but when the company has done this in the past, its tended to favor announcements in the morning, so whatevers coming will likely arrive within the next few hours. We have a pretty good idea of whats coming after months of leaks and rumors, so heres everything we expect to see later today. There wont be a home button The biggest change is that Apple is upending the iPhone SEs design, after leaving it broadly unchanged since the series inception in 2016. The 2022 SE is the last iPhone still using a home button, with a thick bezel around the top and bottom of the screen. But rumors say Apple will now ditch the button, slim the bezel, and add Face ID. The result will be a phone that looks like the iPhone 14 from the front. Like that phone, its expected to place its Face ID sensors in a notch, rather than using the less obtrusive Dynamic Island design that was introduced in the 14 Pro and has been used in every iPhone since then. Apple cant resist keeping its SE series just a little behind the times. Weve seen the notched design in a video shared by the leaker Majin Bu, which shows them handling what is likely a nonfunctional dummy unit, used by case manufacturers to design and test their accessories. Case manufacturer Spigen also showed off renders of the phone when it accidentally published a listing early for one of its cases for the phone. The product page has been taken down, but not before GSMArena grabbed images that closely match the device shown in the video above. but there will be an Action button Bus video and Spigens images both suggest that the SE 4 will include a customizable Action button, but not the Camera Control introduced on the iPhone 16. Like other SE models, it also appears to stick to a single rear camera. One leaked spec list suggests that the SE will use a 48-megapixel sensor on the rear, with a 12-megapixel selfie camera on the front, but this is an area where there have been few reports so far. Its not going to be a small phone The redesign will allow the 2025 SE to have a larger screen than the 4.7-inch panel used by the 2022 model. Its expected to instead use a 6.1-inch display, the same size as the standard iPhone 16, and will also upgrade to OLED. The bigger screen means the phone as a whole will be larger than any previous iPhone SE, and there will no longer be any iPhone smaller than the standard model. If we assume the new phone will have similar dimensions to the iPhone 16, then it could be 9mm taller than the 2022 SE and weigh about 25g more. Lightning is out, USB-C is in Its pretty much certain that the phone will have a USB-C port rather than Lightning, allowing it to once again be sold in the EU. The previous SE model was discontinued in EU markets, along with every other iPhone using a Lightning port. Itll be one of the most powerful iPhones around On the inside, Bloomberg reports that the phone will use the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models. Thats the same approach Apple has used for its last two SE phones, which have paired the latest silicon with more dated designs. The A18 is expected to be combined with an increase to 8GB of RAM, the minimum required to run Apple Intelligence, the companys AI tools that provide notification summaries and other functionality and are now enabled by default. That would all make it more powerful than 2023s iPhone 15. It will even beat this years iPhone 17 series to feature Apples first in-house 5G modem, replacing the Qualcomm components that iPhones have used in the past. Apple has been developing its own modems for over half a decade, but Bloomberg warns that the first iteration is a downgrade from the modem in the latest flagship iPhones and wont support mmWave 5G, only sub-6  though that was true of the last iPhone SE, too. Its coming today Tim Cook has teased a new member of the family, arriving today, and were pretty sure thats the new SE. Bloomberg predicts a price of roughly $500, higher than the 2022 models starting price of $429. That may be offset by a default storage spec of 128GB, meaning there would no longer be any 64GB iPhone on the market. Theres also a possibility that it wont be called the iPhone SE after all. Two leakers have predicted that it will instead be called the iPhone 16E, though, since the SE name has popped up more often, we think thats still more likely. We wont have long to wait to find out for sure. The SE would be the first of several big iPhone launches this year, with Apple tipped to reveal a slimmer iPhone 17 Air as well as major updates to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. Update, February 19th: Updated to reflect the fact that Apples promised announcement is today."

Several boxing luminaries will be in attendance, including former world champions Barry McGuigan and Richie Woodhall, with the main event featuring Englands Cliff Henry against Irelands Ryan Whelan in a Midlands Area light heavyweight title showdown. Christopher, a slick southpaw, relocated to Birmingham more than five years ago to pursue his boxing dreams.

        "content": "The likes of Mel Kiper and Todd McShay are pioneers of the mock-drafting practice and draft analysis in general. Doubt they knew they were spurring chaos unto the sports realm. Draft analysis and all its iterations divide fans, stakeholders, and players alike into two factions. With some overlapping in the middle, sort of like a Venn diagram. Firstly, there are those who consider it a futile activity disassociated with reality. Then, those who consider certain peoples projections gospel and etched in fact. Finally, those who have no strong opinions take them on board but with a pinch of salt. After looking at one persons QB rankings for Aprils NFL Draft, Quinn Ewers will firmly fall into category 1. The curious case of Quinn Ewers. A 5-star prospect coming out of high school whose stock seemingly declined year upon year in college. The 2024 draft saw the most QBs picked in the first round ever. With the competition being that tough, Ewers chose to stick around and enter the draft in 2025 instead. However, hes actually lost ground during a year riddled with injuries. Hes even nursing one to his oblique right now and missed the Senior Bowl as a result. The consensus on Quinn Ewers is that hell be a Day 2 or 3 pick off the board. Not ideal, but still far from an indictment. However, those health concerns run deeper than a receiving route. Theyve now seeped into his NFL grade. CBS Danny Kanell has issued a public warning to front offices eyeing up Ewers. Injuries plagued Quinn Ewers entire college career. After missing time in the 2023 season with an AC joint sprain, he found no respite last season, either. Back in Week 3, he went down with an oblique strain. Ewers returned in Week 7 while Arch Manning held it down in his absence. Turns out, he never fully healed from this injury and played the rest of the year through it. After Texas season ceased in the Cotton Bowl, this finally came to light. With all this and more baked in, Kanell ranks Ewers as the 6th best quarterback in this class. He gave his reasons on CBS Sports HQ. Discerning that all his regression stems from persistent health issues. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad I worry about two things. One, the top tier arm strength. Two are injuries, remarked Kanell. Ewers did not finish any season from start to finish. I wonder how much those injuries impacted his arm strength. The deeper [throws] started to bloop a little bit, started to hang in. Ewers mobility in and out of the pocket was also visibly hindered after he returned last year. His arm strength and mobility, or lack thereof, can also be viewed from a different POVparalysis by analysis. Knowing hes got a future in the NFL beckoning, Ewers could have had issues with confidence or a fear of re-injury. He didnt look like the guy he was from even a year ago. Maybe Arch Manning breathing down his neck was also a factor for him to oversimplify his game. Ewers was largely cruising through games in 2nd gear. Whether this was physical or mental, neither bodes well for franchises weighing him up. Quinn Ewers not partaking in the Senior Bowl means the Combine is ultra important for him to shed concerns about his tangibles and health. But things en route to Indy are looking bleak. Alas, there have even been suggestions that he shouldve returned to college for yet another year. An idea that gained traction after Bengals QB Joe Burrow fanned the flames of it. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Burrow hints at agreeing with the notion Quinn Ewers shouldve remained in College Football There may not be a lot of similarities between Joe Burrow and Quinn Ewers in how theyre perceived entering the NFL. Burrow was a Heisman winner and National Champ with LSU. However, theres one transitive property- both were recruited by Ohio State. Before leaving for greener pastures. Burrow didnt have the portal, though, so he had to graduate before switching base. Neither did he have as many or as lucrative NIL avenues. He spoke about this and implied Quinn Ewers and his kind should consider staying in college longer now. Owing to the money on offer. You should take advantage of NIL, he told Dan Patrick. If youre going to be able to make seven figures in college, youve got to go and take advantage of that. If youre in high school and youre getting offered that, go wherever theyre paying you the most, This came right after Patrick asked him about Ewers. Now, Burrow perhaps didnt mean to direct his statement to Quinn in particular, but it still resounds. Given the market, Ewers couldve likely made more money this season playing CFB than hell make during the entirety of his rookie-scale contract as a late-round pick! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ewers will just hope a solid organization takes a chance on him. The situation a malleable QB walks into can dictate the trajectory of their career. Hell likely have to sit initially wherever he goes. If its an environment conducive to growth, Ewers could well get back to the levels expected of him out of high school. Hes vying for limited landing spots with a bunch of adversaries. There are still a lot of pages left of his story. Albeit injuries have indeed torn some pages out of the proverbial book of his career."

        "content": "In wake of recent remarks, the outside observer might assume there is tension between Red Sox stars Rafael Devers and Alex Bregman. That doesnt seem to be the case, however. Devers made his desires abundantly clear after Boston signed Bregman, bluntly stating that he wanted to stay at third base and had no interest in moving to another position. But that wasnt necessarily a shot at Bregman, who Devers referred to as a great guy and a great addition to the Red Soxs roster. Bregman returned the favor Tuesday when he called Devers a great player and stressed he was super excited to be the three-time All-Stars teammate. The two-time World Series champion also pulled back the curtain on his early interactions with Bostons franchise cornerstone. Theyve been great. Weve been having a lot of fun, Bregman told reporters, per MLB.com. Weve been taking ground balls back here, during our work together. Talking about winning. Talking about baseball. Talking about being excited for the season. Last night we all got together and had dinner. Its great. Story continues below advertisement Bregmans comments corroborated a claim made by Alex Cora, who insisted there was no beef between the pair of star infielders. The Red Sox manager also pointed out how Bregman and Devers had a very lengthy conversation on Bostons first day of full-squad workouts. The Red Sox have quite a bit to figure out before the regular season gets underway in late March. But no matter what Cora decides to do with his talented roster, it seems like all players will buy in for the sake of the greater good."

        "content": "Malware-as-a-Service accounts for 57 percent of all threats By Ian Barker A new report from Darktrace reveals that Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is now responsible for 57 percent of all cyber threats to organizations, a 17 percent increase from the first half of 2024. The use of remote access trojans (RATs) has also seen a significant increase in the latter half of last year, representing 46 percent of campaign activity identified, compared to only 12 percent in the first half. Phishing remains attackers preferred technique, with over 30.4 million phishing emails detected across Darktraces customer base between December 2023 and December 2024. The techniques observed highlight how threat actors continue to curate more targeted and sophisticated emails to improve the success of their campaigns. Of all the phishing emails detected in 2024 38 percent were spear-phishing attempts, tailored attacks on high value individuals, while 32 percent used novel social engineering techniques like QR codes and AI generated text. Whats also concerning is that 70 percent of phishing emails successfully passed the widely used DMARC authentication approach and 55 percent passed through all existing security layers before Darktrace detection. Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace, says, Email is at the forefront of the evolving threats were seeing across the threat landscape. Ransomware-as-a-Service tools, combined with the growing use of AI, are allowing even low-skilled attackers to engineer convincing, targeted email attacks at scale, and making it harder than ever for traditional security measures to keep up. Some of the most significant campaigns observed in 2024 involved the ongoing exploitation of vulnerabilities in edge and perimeter network technologies, with 40 percent of identified campaign activity in the first half of the year involving the exploitation of internet-facing devices. The combination of Cybercrime-as-a-Service, automation and AI are increasing the sophistication and diversity of attack techniques faster than ever  from AI-enhanced phishing campaigns to evolving ransomware strains, adds Jones. Detecting and responding to threats in progress is no longer sufficient. Organizations must prioritize cyber resilience by proactively addressing weaknesses across systems, people, and data before attackers can exploit them. You can find out more on the Darktrace blog.

But the 29-year-olds opponent hasnt had quite as many fights as Anthony Hernandezs record stands at 13 wins and 2 losses. Despite that, the less experienced of the two has a better win percentage. When we look at the other stats, Brendan Allen has lived up to his BJJ black belt status by racking up 14 submission wins and 5 knockouts to go along with it. In fact, the majority of the South Carolina natives fights have ended with a finish, which is somewhat similar to Anthony Hernandez, whos got 11 finishes to his name. In terms of styles, both fighters are, as Mike Goldberg would say, virtually identical. In terms of physical stats, theres not much of a difference between Allen and Hernandez as well. But the former does have a 2-inch height advantage, which may not mean much because it doesnt give him an edge in terms of reach. Now, lets move over to make a final analysis and prediction for the UFC Seattle co-main event. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Allen vs. Hernandez breakdown and prediction It wont be wrong to assume that since their last meeting, Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez have made a tremendous jump in their skill levels. While the latter is currently on a winning streak, All In was in an unbeaten run before losing to Israel Adesanya-slaying Nassourdine Imavov in his last fight. But experience plays a big role in a fight and an edge 24-6 fighter might have the edge here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nevertheless, Anthony Hernande, in the run that hes in right now, has more than showcased his relentlessness and that hes got grit, and his exceptional cardio is something to watch out for. The oddsmakers, meanwhile, have shoved aside the experience factor and have favored Hernandez with their numbers. While Brendan Allen will be heading into the fight as the +240 underdog, his opponent has been picked as the -280 favorite. With a win in their last outing, the California native may take home the win this weekend. Who do you think will win this time around? Will the winner of the UFC Seattle co-main event be Brendan Allen of Anthony Hernandez? Let us know in the comments down below."

        "content": "Four women who allege they were sexually abused by the social media influencer Andrew Tate have urged the US not to interfere in his case in Romania. The women said they were extremely concerned by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, who have dual UK-US nationality. Lawyer Matthew Jury, who is representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC they were absolutely bewildered why the Trump administration has decided to interfere in this way, although Romania denies being pressured by the US. Tate, 38, and his brother were arrested in Romania three years ago and face trial on allegations of rape, trafficking minors and money laundering, all of which they deny. Separately, the brothers are wanted by police in the UK over allegations of rape and human trafficking, which they also deny. Their extradition to the UK will be dealt with once the Romania case finishes. The Financial Times newspaper first reported that US officials had brought up the case with the Romanian government last week, and it was then followed up by Trumps envoy Richard Grenell at the weekend. One source told the paper that a request had been made by the US to return the brothers passports to them so they could travel while waiting for the criminal case against them to finish. The Tate brothers are currently banned from leaving Romania, although are no longer under house arrest. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu confirmed to Euronews that Grenell had raised Tates case with him, and that Grenell had said he was interested in the fate of the Tate brothers. The minister denied this amounted to pressure from Americans. A spokesperson for Mr Hurezeanu told the Financial Times: Romanian courts are independent and operate based on the law, there is due process. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu also denied the reports on X, writing: [The US] has not made any requests to [Romania] upon the legal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by the Romanian authorities. There were no demands either during the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- Richard Grenell discussion or after it. Romania and USA share the same values regarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. According to the FT, Grenell said he had no substantive conversation with Hurezeanu, but added: I support the Tate brothers as evident by my publicly available tweets. The US State Department has been approached by the BBC for comment. The Tate brothers have wide support on right-wing social media, and supported Trump during the US election campaign. Lawyer Mr Jury said: Its very clear from members of the Trump administrations social media posts and public statements that there is a great deal of support for Tate. Either they dont know or they dont care about the nature of the allegations and how serious they are, he told BBC Newsnight. He said the women he represented were absolutely distraught. To see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser, is incredibly traumatising its gaslighting of a sort. And he called the reported US actions a gross interference in my clients right to a fair trial and due process. Mr Jury is representing the four women in a civil case against Tate at the High Court in the UK, after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute their case. The Tate brothers deny the claims. The civil case is separate to the criminal allegations currently being investigated by British police. In their statement, the four women added: We hope that the Romanian and the UK authorities will be left alone to do their jobs. (BBC News)"

        "content": "Pam Shrivers story, from the 1980s, is a chilling reminder of the potential for abuse in sports. Starting with her coach Don Candy at just nine, she rose to tennis stardom, but their relationship turned into an inappropriate and damaging affair, marked by emotional abuse. Now, 4 decades later, were seeing similar red flags with Elena Rybakina and her coach, Stefano Vukov. The 37-year-olds verbal abuse has been well-documented, with him calling Rybakina stupid and telling her that without him she would still be in Russia picking potatoes. One of his most vocal critics has been Rennae Stubbs. Turns out, theres a reason for Stubbss strong stance  they have a history. On February 12, WTA released a statement following an internal investigation against Vukov. Prior to the investigations completion, Vukov was momentarily suspended. But now, the penalty has got elongated. The suspension remains in place. To protect the confidentiality and integrity of the investigation and its findings, the WTA will not provide further details. We remain committed to ensuring that all matters are handled in a fair and objective manner in accordance with the WTA Code of Conduct, read the statement from the agency. Stubbs was quite happy about this news. Expressing her unfiltered opinions, in an episode of her podcast, dated February 15, she said, I think, quite honestly, he should be banned forever on the WTA tour. He should not be allowed to be able to come on the tour and work with any girl because thats his tendency. Well, now shes backed up her words with proof. And guess what? Its coming right from Stubbs own experience with Vukov. But what exactly happened between them? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a new episode of her podcast, dated February 19, Stubbs talked about how WTA took crucial information from different witnesses in its investigation. She then revealed, Listen, I have coached, I have been coached. I have seen other coaches. I know what abuse is. And he is abusive to her. PeriodI could have been one of those witnesses, and I probably was one of those witnesses. But how? Well, its because they interviewed me years ago about him, okay. Because I made comments on this podcast years ago about him, and I never said anything about him abusing her. So what did she tell WTAs team about the Croatians influence on Rybakina? I just said he was very negative, and I felt like with a positive coach how much better could she be. Imagine how good she could be with a really positive coach. And so those are the comments I made about him, she added. However, what happened next completely shocked Stubbs. She revealed that he (Vukov) contacted the WTA and wanted to come after me for making those comments. Stubbs never made this incident public. But after WTAs statement on Vukov last week, she thought it was time to spill the beans. He came after me and wanted to sue me, okay, for saying things about him that were true, that have been now investigated for years, are now true. But it appears there are even more details regarding Vukov that were hitherto unknown. A latest report throws light on how he once allegedly disrespected Rybakinas mothers request! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad When Stefano Vukov reacted harshly to Elena Rybakinas mothers desperate plea A report by The Athletic, dated February 18, revealed tons of new details on Elena Rybakinas ex-coach. It also mentioned various instances involving Vukovs rude conduct with the former World No.3. As it turns out, WTAs chief executive officer Portia Archer submitted a three-page summary to Vukov. In that, she mentioned how he broke the Tours Code of Conduct by ridiculing and abusing the Kazakh tennis player. Archer also wrote that Vukov told Rybakina that without him, she would still be in Russia picking potatoes. Eventually, his tendency to push her beyond her limits caused her physical illness. Thats the reason why Rybakina, perhaps, withdrew from several WTA events last season. The report from Archer further revealed that Rybakinas mother was aware of Vukovs toxic behavior. In fact, she even asked him not to make her daughter cry again. But Vukov didnt acknowledge her request. Instead, he then pulled out from one of the events, refusing to coach the 2023 Australian Open runner-up. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad On the other hand, Rybakinas still defending her former coach. Despite WTAs extended ban on him, she believes whatever has happened to him is just not right. Currently, shes competing at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Following a first round victory over Japans Moyuka Uchijima, she reiterated her stance on Vukov. Its very disappointing the way its been handled, just the outcome. Furthermore, she also cited a lack of support from fellow WTA players. There are couple players Im in touch more. But to say that I have very, very close friends on tour, its I think not true just because we competing against each other. Everybodys surrounded by their teams. Amid all this chaos in her life, it seems her focus is completely on tennis at the moment. She just outclassed Paula Badosa in her second round in Dubai."

        "content": "is a news editor with over a decades experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor. Apple has confirmed that its launching a new product today, and we think itll be the new iPhone SE. It could mark a major shake-up to the companys affordable iPhone line, adding in Face ID and killing off the classic home button. We dont expect Apple to hold a full launch event for the new SE, instead simply announcing the phone on its website. We dont know what time, but when the company has done this in the past, its tended to favor announcements in the morning, so whatevers coming will likely arrive within the next few hours. We have a pretty good idea of whats coming after months of leaks and rumors, so heres everything we expect to see later today. There wont be a home button The biggest change is that Apple is upending the iPhone SEs design, after leaving it broadly unchanged since the series inception in 2016. The 2022 SE is the last iPhone still using a home button, with a thick bezel around the top and bottom of the screen. But rumors say Apple will now ditch the button, slim the bezel, and add Face ID. The result will be a phone that looks like the iPhone 14 from the front. Like that phone, its expected to place its Face ID sensors in a notch, rather than using the less obtrusive Dynamic Island design that was introduced in the 14 Pro and has been used in every iPhone since then. Apple cant resist keeping its SE series just a little behind the times. Weve seen the notched design in a video shared by the leaker Majin Bu, which shows them handling what is likely a nonfunctional dummy unit, used by case manufacturers to design and test their accessories. Case manufacturer Spigen also showed off renders of the phone when it accidentally published a listing early for one of its cases for the phone. The product page has been taken down, but not before GSMArena grabbed images that closely match the device shown in the video above. but there will be an Action button Bus video and Spigens images both suggest that the SE 4 will include a customizable Action button, but not the Camera Control introduced on the iPhone 16. Like other SE models, it also appears to stick to a single rear camera. One leaked spec list suggests that the SE will use a 48-megapixel sensor on the rear, with a 12-megapixel selfie camera on the front, but this is an area where there have been few reports so far. Its not going to be a small phone The redesign will allow the 2025 SE to have a larger screen than the 4.7-inch panel used by the 2022 model. Its expected to instead use a 6.1-inch display, the same size as the standard iPhone 16, and will also upgrade to OLED. The bigger screen means the phone as a whole will be larger than any previous iPhone SE, and there will no longer be any iPhone smaller than the standard model. If we assume the new phone will have similar dimensions to the iPhone 16, then it could be 9mm taller than the 2022 SE and weigh about 25g more. Lightning is out, USB-C is in Its pretty much certain that the phone will have a USB-C port rather than Lightning, allowing it to once again be sold in the EU. The previous SE model was discontinued in EU markets, along with every other iPhone using a Lightning port. Itll be one of the most powerful iPhones around On the inside, Bloomberg reports that the phone will use the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models. Thats the same approach Apple has used for its last two SE phones, which have paired the latest silicon with more dated designs. The A18 is expected to be combined with an increase to 8GB of RAM, the minimum required to run Apple Intelligence, the companys AI tools that provide notification summaries and other functionality and are now enabled by default. That would all make it more powerful than 2023s iPhone 15. It will even beat this years iPhone 17 series to feature Apples first in-house 5G modem, replacing the Qualcomm components that iPhones have used in the past. Apple has been developing its own modems for over half a decade, but Bloomberg warns that the first iteration is a downgrade from the modem in the latest flagship iPhones and wont support mmWave 5G, only sub-6  though that was true of the last iPhone SE, too. Its coming today Tim Cook has teased a new member of the family, arriving today, and were pretty sure thats the new SE. Bloomberg predicts a price of roughly $500, higher than the 2022 models starting price of $429. That may be offset by a default storage spec of 128GB, meaning there would no longer be any 64GB iPhone on the market. Theres also a possibility that it wont be called the iPhone SE after all. Two leakers have predicted that it will instead be called the iPhone 16E, though, since the SE name has popped up more often, we think thats still more likely. We wont have long to wait to find out for sure. The SE would be the first of several big iPhone launches this year, with Apple tipped to reveal a slimmer iPhone 17 Air as well as major updates to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. Update, February 19th: Updated to reflect the fact that Apples promised announcement is today."

        "content": "The likes of Mel Kiper and Todd McShay are pioneers of the mock-drafting practice and draft analysis in general. Doubt they knew they were spurring chaos unto the sports realm. Draft analysis and all its iterations divide fans, stakeholders, and players alike into two factions. With some overlapping in the middle, sort of like a Venn diagram. Firstly, there are those who consider it a futile activity disassociated with reality. Then, those who consider certain peoples projections gospel and etched in fact. Finally, those who have no strong opinions take them on board but with a pinch of salt. After looking at one persons QB rankings for Aprils NFL Draft, Quinn Ewers will firmly fall into category 1. The curious case of Quinn Ewers. A 5-star prospect coming out of high school whose stock seemingly declined year upon year in college. The 2024 draft saw the most QBs picked in the first round ever. With the competition being that tough, Ewers chose to stick around and enter the draft in 2025 instead. However, hes actually lost ground during a year riddled with injuries. Hes even nursing one to his oblique right now and missed the Senior Bowl as a result. The consensus on Quinn Ewers is that hell be a Day 2 or 3 pick off the board. Not ideal, but still far from an indictment. However, those health concerns run deeper than a receiving route. Theyve now seeped into his NFL grade. CBS Danny Kanell has issued a public warning to front offices eyeing up Ewers. Injuries plagued Quinn Ewers entire college career. After missing time in the 2023 season with an AC joint sprain, he found no respite last season, either. Back in Week 3, he went down with an oblique strain. Ewers returned in Week 7 while Arch Manning held it down in his absence. Turns out, he never fully healed from this injury and played the rest of the year through it. After Texas season ceased in the Cotton Bowl, this finally came to light. With all this and more baked in, Kanell ranks Ewers as the 6th best quarterback in this class. He gave his reasons on CBS Sports HQ. Discerning that all his regression stems from persistent health issues. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad I worry about two things. One, the top tier arm strength. Two are injuries, remarked Kanell. Ewers did not finish any season from start to finish. I wonder how much those injuries impacted his arm strength. The deeper [throws] started to bloop a little bit, started to hang in. Ewers mobility in and out of the pocket was also visibly hindered after he returned last year. His arm strength and mobility, or lack thereof, can also be viewed from a different POVparalysis by analysis. Knowing hes got a future in the NFL beckoning, Ewers could have had issues with confidence or a fear of re-injury. He didnt look like the guy he was from even a year ago. Maybe Arch Manning breathing down his neck was also a factor for him to oversimplify his game. Ewers was largely cruising through games in 2nd gear. Whether this was physical or mental, neither bodes well for franchises weighing him up. Quinn Ewers not partaking in the Senior Bowl means the Combine is ultra important for him to shed concerns about his tangibles and health. But things en route to Indy are looking bleak. Alas, there have even been suggestions that he shouldve returned to college for yet another year. An idea that gained traction after Bengals QB Joe Burrow fanned the flames of it. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Burrow hints at agreeing with the notion Quinn Ewers shouldve remained in College Football There may not be a lot of similarities between Joe Burrow and Quinn Ewers in how theyre perceived entering the NFL. Burrow was a Heisman winner and National Champ with LSU. However, theres one transitive property- both were recruited by Ohio State. Before leaving for greener pastures. Burrow didnt have the portal, though, so he had to graduate before switching base. Neither did he have as many or as lucrative NIL avenues. He spoke about this and implied Quinn Ewers and his kind should consider staying in college longer now. Owing to the money on offer. You should take advantage of NIL, he told Dan Patrick. If youre going to be able to make seven figures in college, youve got to go and take advantage of that. If youre in high school and youre getting offered that, go wherever theyre paying you the most, This came right after Patrick asked him about Ewers. Now, Burrow perhaps didnt mean to direct his statement to Quinn in particular, but it still resounds. Given the market, Ewers couldve likely made more money this season playing CFB than hell make during the entirety of his rookie-scale contract as a late-round pick! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ewers will just hope a solid organization takes a chance on him. The situation a malleable QB walks into can dictate the trajectory of their career. Hell likely have to sit initially wherever he goes. If its an environment conducive to growth, Ewers could well get back to the levels expected of him out of high school. Hes vying for limited landing spots with a bunch of adversaries. There are still a lot of pages left of his story. Albeit injuries have indeed torn some pages out of the proverbial book of his career."

        "content": "In wake of recent remarks, the outside observer might assume there is tension between Red Sox stars Rafael Devers and Alex Bregman. That doesnt seem to be the case, however. Devers made his desires abundantly clear after Boston signed Bregman, bluntly stating that he wanted to stay at third base and had no interest in moving to another position. But that wasnt necessarily a shot at Bregman, who Devers referred to as a great guy and a great addition to the Red Soxs roster. Bregman returned the favor Tuesday when he called Devers a great player and stressed he was super excited to be the three-time All-Stars teammate. The two-time World Series champion also pulled back the curtain on his early interactions with Bostons franchise cornerstone. Theyve been great. Weve been having a lot of fun, Bregman told reporters, per MLB.com. Weve been taking ground balls back here, during our work together. Talking about winning. Talking about baseball. Talking about being excited for the season. Last night we all got together and had dinner. Its great. Story continues below advertisement Bregmans comments corroborated a claim made by Alex Cora, who insisted there was no beef between the pair of star infielders. The Red Sox manager also pointed out how Bregman and Devers had a very lengthy conversation on Bostons first day of full-squad workouts. The Red Sox have quite a bit to figure out before the regular season gets underway in late March. But no matter what Cora decides to do with his talented roster, it seems like all players will buy in for the sake of the greater good."

        "content": "Malware-as-a-Service accounts for 57 percent of all threats By Ian Barker A new report from Darktrace reveals that Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is now responsible for 57 percent of all cyber threats to organizations, a 17 percent increase from the first half of 2024. The use of remote access trojans (RATs) has also seen a significant increase in the latter half of last year, representing 46 percent of campaign activity identified, compared to only 12 percent in the first half. Phishing remains attackers preferred technique, with over 30.4 million phishing emails detected across Darktraces customer base between December 2023 and December 2024. The techniques observed highlight how threat actors continue to curate more targeted and sophisticated emails to improve the success of their campaigns. Of all the phishing emails detected in 2024 38 percent were spear-phishing attempts, tailored attacks on high value individuals, while 32 percent used novel social engineering techniques like QR codes and AI generated text. Whats also concerning is that 70 percent of phishing emails successfully passed the widely used DMARC authentication approach and 55 percent passed through all existing security layers before Darktrace detection. Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace, says, Email is at the forefront of the evolving threats were seeing across the threat landscape. Ransomware-as-a-Service tools, combined with the growing use of AI, are allowing even low-skilled attackers to engineer convincing, targeted email attacks at scale, and making it harder than ever for traditional security measures to keep up. Some of the most significant campaigns observed in 2024 involved the ongoing exploitation of vulnerabilities in edge and perimeter network technologies, with 40 percent of identified campaign activity in the first half of the year involving the exploitation of internet-facing devices. The combination of Cybercrime-as-a-Service, automation and AI are increasing the sophistication and diversity of attack techniques faster than ever  from AI-enhanced phishing campaigns to evolving ransomware strains, adds Jones. Detecting and responding to threats in progress is no longer sufficient. Organizations must prioritize cyber resilience by proactively addressing weaknesses across systems, people, and data before attackers can exploit them. You can find out more on the Darktrace blog.

        "content": "As Henry Cejudo returns to headline UFC Seattle against Song Yadong, this Fight Night has a high-stakes co-main event between two ranked middleweight contenders. Its #9 vs #12 as Brendan Allen returns after almost five months to butt heads against Anthony Hernandez, who riding high with momentum on his side with a 6-fight winning streak under his belt. While talking about the title contenders in the 185-pound division that includes some of the top stars in the promotion, we often lose sight of whats cooking on the lower side of the rankings. Brendan All In Allen and Anthony Fluffy Hernandez are both making waves with impressive performances, so lets take a look at how their fight could end this weekend. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad UFC Seattle: Brendan Allen vs. Anthony Hernandez stats As high-stakes a fight as it seems, its also a rematch between Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez. Before they fought in the UFC, the middleweight duo had their first scrap back in 2018 when they were competing under the Legacy Fighting Alliance banner. All In may be ranked higher than his 31-year-old counterpart now, but on that night, the South Carolina native came up short as he lost to his Fluffy via a decision win. But since then, Brendan Allen has gone on to amass an incredible record of 24 wins with only six losses. But the 29-year-olds opponent hasnt had quite as many fights as Anthony Hernandezs record stands at 13 wins and 2 losses. Despite that, the less experienced of the two has a better win percentage. When we look at the other stats, Brendan Allen has lived up to his BJJ black belt status by racking up 14 submission wins and 5 knockouts to go along with it. In fact, the majority of the South Carolina natives fights have ended with a finish, which is somewhat similar to Anthony Hernandez, whos got 11 finishes to his name. In terms of styles, both fighters are, as Mike Goldberg would say, virtually identical. In terms of physical stats, theres not much of a difference between Allen and Hernandez as well. But the former does have a 2-inch height advantage, which may not mean much because it doesnt give him an edge in terms of reach. Now, lets move over to make a final analysis and prediction for the UFC Seattle co-main event. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Allen vs. Hernandez breakdown and prediction It wont be wrong to assume that since their last meeting, Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez have made a tremendous jump in their skill levels. While the latter is currently on a winning streak, All In was in an unbeaten run before losing to Israel Adesanya-slaying Nassourdine Imavov in his last fight. But experience plays a big role in a fight and an edge 24-6 fighter might have the edge here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nevertheless, Anthony Hernande, in the run that hes in right now, has more than showcased his relentlessness and that hes got grit, and his exceptional cardio is something to watch out for. The oddsmakers, meanwhile, have shoved aside the experience factor and have favored Hernandez with their numbers. While Brendan Allen will be heading into the fight as the +240 underdog, his opponent has been picked as the -280 favorite. With a win in their last outing, the California native may take home the win this weekend. Who do you think will win this time around? Will the winner of the UFC Seattle co-main event be Brendan Allen of Anthony Hernandez? Let us know in the comments down below."

        "content": "Four women who allege they were sexually abused by the social media influencer Andrew Tate have urged the US not to interfere in his case in Romania. The women said they were extremely concerned by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, who have dual UK-US nationality. Lawyer Matthew Jury, who is representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC they were absolutely bewildered why the Trump administration has decided to interfere in this way, although Romania denies being pressured by the US. Tate, 38, and his brother were arrested in Romania three years ago and face trial on allegations of rape, trafficking minors and money laundering, all of which they deny. Separately, the brothers are wanted by police in the UK over allegations of rape and human trafficking, which they also deny. Their extradition to the UK will be dealt with once the Romania case finishes. The Financial Times newspaper first reported that US officials had brought up the case with the Romanian government last week, and it was then followed up by Trumps envoy Richard Grenell at the weekend. One source told the paper that a request had been made by the US to return the brothers passports to them so they could travel while waiting for the criminal case against them to finish. The Tate brothers are currently banned from leaving Romania, although are no longer under house arrest. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu confirmed to Euronews that Grenell had raised Tates case with him, and that Grenell had said he was interested in the fate of the Tate brothers. The minister denied this amounted to pressure from Americans. A spokesperson for Mr Hurezeanu told the Financial Times: Romanian courts are independent and operate based on the law, there is due process. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu also denied the reports on X, writing: [The US] has not made any requests to [Romania] upon the legal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by the Romanian authorities. There were no demands either during the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- Richard Grenell discussion or after it. Romania and USA share the same values regarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. According to the FT, Grenell said he had no substantive conversation with Hurezeanu, but added: I support the Tate brothers as evident by my publicly available tweets. The US State Department has been approached by the BBC for comment. The Tate brothers have wide support on right-wing social media, and supported Trump during the US election campaign. Lawyer Mr Jury said: Its very clear from members of the Trump administrations social media posts and public statements that there is a great deal of support for Tate. Either they dont know or they dont care about the nature of the allegations and how serious they are, he told BBC Newsnight. He said the women he represented were absolutely distraught. To see the most powerful man in the world support their alleged abuser, is incredibly traumatising its gaslighting of a sort. And he called the reported US actions a gross interference in my clients right to a fair trial and due process. Mr Jury is representing the four women in a civil case against Tate at the High Court in the UK, after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute their case. The Tate brothers deny the claims. The civil case is separate to the criminal allegations currently being investigated by British police. In their statement, the four women added: We hope that the Romanian and the UK authorities will be left alone to do their jobs. (BBC News)"

        "content": "is a news editor with over a decades experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor. Apple has confirmed that its launching a new product today, and we think itll be the new iPhone SE. It could mark a major shake-up to the companys affordable iPhone line, adding in Face ID and killing off the classic home button. We dont expect Apple to hold a full launch event for the new SE, instead simply announcing the phone on its website. We dont know what time, but when the company has done this in the past, its tended to favor announcements in the morning, so whatevers coming will likely arrive within the next few hours. We have a pretty good idea of whats coming after months of leaks and rumors, so heres everything we expect to see later today. There wont be a home button The biggest change is that Apple is upending the iPhone SEs design, after leaving it broadly unchanged since the series inception in 2016. The 2022 SE is the last iPhone still using a home button, with a thick bezel around the top and bottom of the screen. But rumors say Apple will now ditch the button, slim the bezel, and add Face ID. The result will be a phone that looks like the iPhone 14 from the front. Like that phone, its expected to place its Face ID sensors in a notch, rather than using the less obtrusive Dynamic Island design that was introduced in the 14 Pro and has been used in every iPhone since then. Apple cant resist keeping its SE series just a little behind the times. Weve seen the notched design in a video shared by the leaker Majin Bu, which shows them handling what is likely a nonfunctional dummy unit, used by case manufacturers to design and test their accessories. Case manufacturer Spigen also showed off renders of the phone when it accidentally published a listing early for one of its cases for the phone. The product page has been taken down, but not before GSMArena grabbed images that closely match the device shown in the video above. but there will be an Action button Bus video and Spigens images both suggest that the SE 4 will include a customizable Action button, but not the Camera Control introduced on the iPhone 16. Like other SE models, it also appears to stick to a single rear camera. One leaked spec list suggests that the SE will use a 48-megapixel sensor on the rear, with a 12-megapixel selfie camera on the front, but this is an area where there have been few reports so far. Its not going to be a small phone The redesign will allow the 2025 SE to have a larger screen than the 4.7-inch panel used by the 2022 model. Its expected to instead use a 6.1-inch display, the same size as the standard iPhone 16, and will also upgrade to OLED. The bigger screen means the phone as a whole will be larger than any previous iPhone SE, and there will no longer be any iPhone smaller than the standard model. If we assume the new phone will have similar dimensions to the iPhone 16, then it could be 9mm taller than the 2022 SE and weigh about 25g more. Lightning is out, USB-C is in Its pretty much certain that the phone will have a USB-C port rather than Lightning, allowing it to once again be sold in the EU. The previous SE model was discontinued in EU markets, along with every other iPhone using a Lightning port. Itll be one of the most powerful iPhones around On the inside, Bloomberg reports that the phone will use the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models. Thats the same approach Apple has used for its last two SE phones, which have paired the latest silicon with more dated designs. The A18 is expected to be combined with an increase to 8GB of RAM, the minimum required to run Apple Intelligence, the companys AI tools that provide notification summaries and other functionality and are now enabled by default. That would all make it more powerful than 2023s iPhone 15. It will even beat this years iPhone 17 series to feature Apples first in-house 5G modem, replacing the Qualcomm components that iPhones have used in the past. Apple has been developing its own modems for over half a decade, but Bloomberg warns that the first iteration is a downgrade from the modem in the latest flagship iPhones and wont support mmWave 5G, only sub-6  though that was true of the last iPhone SE, too. Its coming today Tim Cook has teased a new member of the family, arriving today, and were pretty sure thats the new SE. Bloomberg predicts a price of roughly $500, higher than the 2022 models starting price of $429. That may be offset by a default storage spec of 128GB, meaning there would no longer be any 64GB iPhone on the market. Theres also a possibility that it wont be called the iPhone SE after all. Two leakers have predicted that it will instead be called the iPhone 16E, though, since the SE name has popped up more often, we think thats still more likely. We wont have long to wait to find out for sure. The SE would be the first of several big iPhone launches this year, with Apple tipped to reveal a slimmer iPhone 17 Air as well as major updates to the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. Update, February 19th: Updated to reflect the fact that Apples promised announcement is today."

        "content": "[Written by Stephen Wright] Boxer Tyler Christopher is set to chase his tenth consecutive victory in the paid ranks when he steps into the ring against Englands Jordan Grannum on March 6. The middleweight bout will take place in Cannock, Staffordshire, on the undercard of the St Patricks Professional Boxing Dinner Show at the Premier Suite. It will mark Christophers first fight since his impressive points win over Cameroonian Serge Ambomo in Birmingham in May last year. Christopher will take a significant step forward in his career by competing in a six-round contest for the first time. The 32-year-old Grannum, a seasoned journeyman, has a wealth of experience, having won 12 and drawn five of his 168 bouts. Several boxing luminaries will be in attendance, including former world champions Barry McGuigan and Richie Woodhall, with the main event featuring Englands Cliff Henry against Irelands Ryan Whelan in a Midlands Area light heavyweight title showdown. Christopher, a slick southpaw, relocated to Birmingham more than five years ago to pursue his boxing dreams. He has been honing his craft at the D&A Boxing School of Excellence in Stirchley under the guidance of coach Anthony Hull. Read More About Category: All, Sports"

        "content": "The likes of Mel Kiper and Todd McShay are pioneers of the mock-drafting practice and draft analysis in general. Doubt they knew they were spurring chaos unto the sports realm. Draft analysis and all its iterations divide fans, stakeholders, and players alike into two factions. With some overlapping in the middle, sort of like a Venn diagram. Firstly, there are those who consider it a futile activity disassociated with reality. Then, those who consider certain peoples projections gospel and etched in fact. Finally, those who have no strong opinions take them on board but with a pinch of salt. After looking at one persons QB rankings for Aprils NFL Draft, Quinn Ewers will firmly fall into category 1. The curious case of Quinn Ewers. A 5-star prospect coming out of high school whose stock seemingly declined year upon year in college. The 2024 draft saw the most QBs picked in the first round ever. With the competition being that tough, Ewers chose to stick around and enter the draft in 2025 instead. However, hes actually lost ground during a year riddled with injuries. Hes even nursing one to his oblique right now and missed the Senior Bowl as a result. The consensus on Quinn Ewers is that hell be a Day 2 or 3 pick off the board. Not ideal, but still far from an indictment. However, those health concerns run deeper than a receiving route. Theyve now seeped into his NFL grade. CBS Danny Kanell has issued a public warning to front offices eyeing up Ewers. Injuries plagued Quinn Ewers entire college career. After missing time in the 2023 season with an AC joint sprain, he found no respite last season, either. Back in Week 3, he went down with an oblique strain. Ewers returned in Week 7 while Arch Manning held it down in his absence. Turns out, he never fully healed from this injury and played the rest of the year through it. After Texas season ceased in the Cotton Bowl, this finally came to light. With all this and more baked in, Kanell ranks Ewers as the 6th best quarterback in this class. He gave his reasons on CBS Sports HQ. Discerning that all his regression stems from persistent health issues. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad I worry about two things. One, the top tier arm strength. Two are injuries, remarked Kanell. Ewers did not finish any season from start to finish. I wonder how much those injuries impacted his arm strength. The deeper [throws] started to bloop a little bit, started to hang in. Ewers mobility in and out of the pocket was also visibly hindered after he returned last year. His arm strength and mobility, or lack thereof, can also be viewed from a different POVparalysis by analysis. Knowing hes got a future in the NFL beckoning, Ewers could have had issues with confidence or a fear of re-injury. He didnt look like the guy he was from even a year ago. Maybe Arch Manning breathing down his neck was also a factor for him to oversimplify his game. Ewers was largely cruising through games in 2nd gear. Whether this was physical or mental, neither bodes well for franchises weighing him up. Quinn Ewers not partaking in the Senior Bowl means the Combine is ultra important for him to shed concerns about his tangibles and health. But things en route to Indy are looking bleak. Alas, there have even been suggestions that he shouldve returned to college for yet another year. An idea that gained traction after Bengals QB Joe Burrow fanned the flames of it. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Joe Burrow hints at agreeing with the notion Quinn Ewers shouldve remained in College Football There may not be a lot of similarities between Joe Burrow and Quinn Ewers in how theyre perceived entering the NFL. Burrow was a Heisman winner and National Champ with LSU. However, theres one transitive property- both were recruited by Ohio State. Before leaving for greener pastures. Burrow didnt have the portal, though, so he had to graduate before switching base. Neither did he have as many or as lucrative NIL avenues. He spoke about this and implied Quinn Ewers and his kind should consider staying in college longer now. Owing to the money on offer. You should take advantage of NIL, he told Dan Patrick. If youre going to be able to make seven figures in college, youve got to go and take advantage of that. If youre in high school and youre getting offered that, go wherever theyre paying you the most, This came right after Patrick asked him about Ewers. Now, Burrow perhaps didnt mean to direct his statement to Quinn in particular, but it still resounds. Given the market, Ewers couldve likely made more money this season playing CFB than hell make during the entirety of his rookie-scale contract as a late-round pick! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ewers will just hope a solid organization takes a chance on him. The situation a malleable QB walks into can dictate the trajectory of their career. Hell likely have to sit initially wherever he goes. If its an environment conducive to growth, Ewers could well get back to the levels expected of him out of high school. Hes vying for limited landing spots with a bunch of adversaries. There are still a lot of pages left of his story. Albeit injuries have indeed torn some pages out of the proverbial book of his career."

        "content": "In wake of recent remarks, the outside observer might assume there is tension between Red Sox stars Rafael Devers and Alex Bregman. That doesnt seem to be the case, however. Devers made his desires abundantly clear after Boston signed Bregman, bluntly stating that he wanted to stay at third base and had no interest in moving to another position. But that wasnt necessarily a shot at Bregman, who Devers referred to as a great guy and a great addition to the Red Soxs roster. Bregman returned the favor Tuesday when he called Devers a great player and stressed he was super excited to be the three-time All-Stars teammate. The two-time World Series champion also pulled back the curtain on his early interactions with Bostons franchise cornerstone. Theyve been great. Weve been having a lot of fun, Bregman told reporters, per MLB.com. Weve been taking ground balls back here, during our work together. Talking about winning. Talking about baseball. Talking about being excited for the season. Last night we all got together and had dinner. Its great. Story continues below advertisement Bregmans comments corroborated a claim made by Alex Cora, who insisted there was no beef between the pair of star infielders. The Red Sox manager also pointed out how Bregman and Devers had a very lengthy conversation on Bostons first day of full-squad workouts. The Red Sox have quite a bit to figure out before the regular season gets underway in late March. But no matter what Cora decides to do with his talented roster, it seems like all players will buy in for the sake of the greater good."

        "content": "Malware-as-a-Service accounts for 57 percent of all threats By Ian Barker A new report from Darktrace reveals that Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) is now responsible for 57 percent of all cyber threats to organizations, a 17 percent increase from the first half of 2024. The use of remote access trojans (RATs) has also seen a significant increase in the latter half of last year, representing 46 percent of campaign activity identified, compared to only 12 percent in the first half. Phishing remains attackers preferred technique, with over 30.4 million phishing emails detected across Darktraces customer base between December 2023 and December 2024. The techniques observed highlight how threat actors continue to curate more targeted and sophisticated emails to improve the success of their campaigns. Of all the phishing emails detected in 2024 38 percent were spear-phishing attempts, tailored attacks on high value individuals, while 32 percent used novel social engineering techniques like QR codes and AI generated text. Whats also concerning is that 70 percent of phishing emails successfully passed the widely used DMARC authentication approach and 55 percent passed through all existing security layers before Darktrace detection. Nathaniel Jones, VP of threat research at Darktrace, says, Email is at the forefront of the evolving threats were seeing across the threat landscape. Ransomware-as-a-Service tools, combined with the growing use of AI, are allowing even low-skilled attackers to engineer convincing, targeted email attacks at scale, and making it harder than ever for traditional security measures to keep up. Some of the most significant campaigns observed in 2024 involved the ongoing exploitation of vulnerabilities in edge and perimeter network technologies, with 40 percent of identified campaign activity in the first half of the year involving the exploitation of internet-facing devices. The combination of Cybercrime-as-a-Service, automation and AI are increasing the sophistication and diversity of attack techniques faster than ever  from AI-enhanced phishing campaigns to evolving ransomware strains, adds Jones. Detecting and responding to threats in progress is no longer sufficient. Organizations must prioritize cyber resilience by proactively addressing weaknesses across systems, people, and data before attackers can exploit them. You can find out more on the Darktrace blog.

Its #9 vs #12 as Brendan Allen returns after almost five months to butt heads against Anthony Hernandez, who riding high with momentum on his side with a 6-fight winning streak under his belt. While talking about the title contenders in the 185-pound division that includes some of the top stars in the promotion, we often lose sight of whats cooking on the lower side of the rankings. Brendan All In Allen and Anthony Fluffy Hernandez are both making waves with impressive performances, so lets take a look at how their fight could end this weekend. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad UFC Seattle: Brendan Allen vs. Anthony Hernandez stats As high-stakes a fight as it seems, its also a rematch between Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez. Before they fought in the UFC, the middleweight duo had their first scrap back in 2018 when they were competing under the Legacy Fighting Alliance banner. All In may be ranked higher than his 31-year-old counterpart now, but on that night, the South Carolina native came up short as he lost to his Fluffy via a decision win. But since then, Brendan Allen has gone on to amass an incredible record of 24 wins with only six losses. But the 29-year-olds opponent hasnt had quite as many fights as Anthony Hernandezs record stands at 13 wins and 2 losses. Despite that, the less experienced of the two has a better win percentage. When we look at the other stats, Brendan Allen has lived up to his BJJ black belt status by racking up 14 submission wins and 5 knockouts to go along with it. In fact, the majority of the South Carolina natives fights have ended with a finish, which is somewhat similar to Anthony Hernandez, whos got 11 finishes to his name. In terms of styles, both fighters are, as Mike Goldberg would say, virtually identical. In terms of physical stats, theres not much of a difference between Allen and Hernandez as well. But the former does have a 2-inch height advantage, which may not mean much because it doesnt give him an edge in terms of reach. Now, lets move over to make a final analysis and prediction for the UFC Seattle co-main event. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Allen vs. Hernandez breakdown and prediction It wont be wrong to assume that since their last meeting, Brendan Allen and Anthony Hernandez have made a tremendous jump in their skill levels. While the latter is currently on a winning streak, All In was in an unbeaten run before losing to Israel Adesanya-slaying Nassourdine Imavov in his last fight. But experience plays a big role in a fight and an edge 24-6 fighter might have the edge here. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Nevertheless, Anthony Hernande, in the run that hes in right now, has more than showcased his relentlessness and that hes got grit, and his exceptional cardio is something to watch out for. The oddsmakers, meanwhile, have shoved aside the experience factor and have favored Hernandez with their numbers. While Brendan Allen will be heading into the fight as the +240 underdog, his opponent has been picked as the -280 favorite. With a win in their last outing, the California native may take home the win this weekend. Who do you think will win this time around? Will the winner of the UFC Seattle co-main event be Brendan Allen of Anthony Hernandez? Let us know in the comments down below."
